2020-10-29 16:11:34 : Joint pain at 23 years old? : theoatpie123 : https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/jkcyd5/joint_pain_at_23_years_old/

Hi, I'm a 23 year old female and just wanted some opinions. About three or so weeks ago I started having moderate pain in my right foot where I had broken it around 2011, but then the pain started to spread more. I had originally fractured my fourth metatarsal growth plate and my fifth metatarsal bone, but the pain has begun to spread more upward of my foot and to my ankle. I did have surgery on my right foot in 2014 to remove an extra navicular bone (I have this extra bone in my left foot as well, but without much complication). This past week my left foot has started to hurt as well. Now the joint soreness and pain has spread to other joints (mainly my knees and my hand/wrist). I was told by podiatrists previously that I would end up with arthritis at some point in my feet, but now I'm worried that something else is causing all of this pain. I had scheduled an appointment with a podiatrist for next week for my right foot pain, but now that the pain is spreading I'm unsure if I should see a different doctor. I also have a bump on the top of my right foot at the base of my fifth metatarsal bone towards my ankle, it's rather small but it has been there for a long time. The pain in my fingers and wrist isn't very severe, if anything it feels more like a minor throbbing/burning sensation that is just super annoying but tolerable. Any thoughts on if I should just see the podiatrist and see what they say or if I should try going to a primary care doctor?

Hello everyone! My name is Rob, I'm the founder of Qualify For Solar, we are a small tech startup who's aim is to revolutionize the way customers and renewable energy providers engage.

We believe that the current industry standards are not transparent, and rely on shady marketing tactics.

So we are set out to change that by introducing free, up-front, 100% transparent tools and information to help consumers make better informed decisions, without accidentally selling their information to marketers and regretting the decision to "learn more about solar" as is often the case in this industry.

Feel free to ask me any personal questions you have and I'll happily respond to them as soon as possible.

In the meantime, check out Google's free service here: [https://www.google.com/get/sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof)

You simply type the address you want to see, and if they've covered that area with their heat signatures yet, then you'll be able to visualize it as well as receive a rough estimate on projected savings.

It is not entirely accurate and still I've seen mistakes on it, but it is a good tool to get started when you're trying to decide about whether solar is a good fit for your home or property.

I simply want to remove the barriers and make it easier for customers to achieve this. We are working with a small team to develop software and new integrative technologies that will definitely make it more mainstream and help connect investors, consumers, companies, and the public sectors alike.

Thanks for taking an interest in renewable energy! The future of our planet relies on our education and action!

For the uninitiated, DC's Act of God was a brief series where everyone's powers - regardless of origin - simply shut off.  Alien biology, magical prowess, radiation, Atlantean physiology, whatever; if you were not a baseline human, you were immediately made one.  The only heroes left unscathed were those that utilized technology and training in their crimefighting (read: only a certain pointy-eared Gothamite could still operate)

If this same event were to happen with Marvel characters - again, regardless of origin - how would things play out?

I went to essence yesterday and was denied access because my medcard was from out of state, they tried to confiscate my nonresident medical declaration saying, “who gave you this, your not allowed to have this” (I got it from the grove dispensary after making a purchase earlier that morning), I went over to Sahara wellness and had no issues whatsoever. Has anyone else every experienced this? It blows my mind that a dispensary with such a high repertoire is so out of touch with the reciprocity laws of their state

Me and a few friends are going ghost hunting tomorrow for a bit of a Halloween spook, going to a supposedly haunted location where a soldier was killed, a husband burned his wife alive and someone also killed themselves on the property where they were also buried, as someone who killed themselves weren't allowed to be buried in a graveyard at the time. It's a pretty old house, people have reported seeing someone in the trees beside it, and stones being thrown at people. One of the rooms remained locked presumably the room where the person commited suicide, a few paranormal investigators have visited the location. It is quite far away from the main road and requires a long walk. What should we do to maintain our safety and try to invoke some sort of activity?

Hello guys,

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/hb5xkb/denied\_for\_chase\_freedom\_fico\_763\_and\_75k\_income/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/hb5xkb/denied_for_chase_freedom_fico_763_and_75k_income/)

This is my previous post. Basically Chase wanted to see income verification for my first Chase card and I got approved later (Freedom).

I applied for Freedom Flex the other day, 4 months after getting the first card. However, it showed me the classic "We'll send mail" response. So I called recon and they are asking for income verification again? I thought 4 months would be enough record for them to believe me and I already provided income verification 4 months ago so it would be good but guess not. 

It's also super annoying that they only accept the verification via mail or fax... I don't have printer because who needs one these days? I'm literally going through extra steps for each card from Chase and I'm not sure if that's all worth it as I am planning to get the Freedom Unlimited and Sapphire down the road. Guess they will trust me by then? I'm just thinking about hoping onto Amex after this (or do they do the same thing??).

2020-10-29 16:11:51 : Side by side: Building sideboard on Penny Dreadful : Takeoutree : https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyDreadfulMTG/comments/jkcykv/side_by_side_building_sideboard_on_penny_dreadful/

[Original article.](https://mtg.cardsrealm.com/articles/side-by-side:-construindo-sideboard-no-penny-dreadful)

# In this week's article we will explore tips and various pieces for a good sideboard on Penny Dreadful, in addition to that summary and the decklists of the week.  

  
Ending the 4th weekend of season 18, with the next 10 weeks still to come (quantity expected for the next rotation), let's talk in today's article about a very important topic that can define matches, the sideboard.  If you don't like to build a deck from scratch, or maybe you even like to create but you don't think you have much experience, to help you, I bring here the most used cards on the decks that are working, the proportions and also some ideas that can be used to generate more value from your post side strategy. 

Before starting talking about the cards, it is important to reinforce that a good side is one that can deal with several strategies effectively. Remember that you will normally exchange 4 to 7 cards between games, which are several copies of the same card, exchanging only 1 card will not make you draw exactly this card in the middle of 60 during the entire game. Maybe that's why, many of the decks that made top1 have more focused and less diversified sideboards (used 2 to 3 sets of 4 cards to have a post side consistency) this I think is the &gt;!first tip: !&lt;**focus your side, put only 1 card for dealing with each problem will not be effective.**

Exploring how the most used cards are, below you will see the table with the top 100 most used cards so far in the tournaments, and right away we see **Tormod's Crypt**, without cost to play, being able to come in any color to combat decks that use resources from record as Dredge, Reanimate Turno 1 win and even Cycling (used in the latter to disable **Zenith Flare**). It appeared in 67% of the lists and in 65% of the top1 decks, usually 2 to 4 copies. Another good option to deal with the bass that appears in the top 10 is the **Nihil Spellbomb**, for the option to draw for just 1 cost when popping it, there are lists using the main deck. 

[Top 100 cards most used, only tournaments in Season 18, without basic lands.](https://preview.redd.it/7m6vhufxz1w51.png?width=969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5ad6caf9a714405314e29184665631f4cd36916)

As a great combo blocker, **Deafening Silence** is widely used from 2 to 3 copies on the sides as well as the **Ethersworn Canonist** who most of the time already goes from the main deck. Another factor that removes the deck combos from the domain in the format were the possibilities of removing the pieces still on the deck such as **Cranial Extraction**, **Memoricide**, **Slaughter Games** and **Stain the Mind**. 

Going back to talking about Grave hate, we have some possibilities like **Tymaret, Chosen from Death** and **Cling to Dust** that can play up to the main. Another one that appears most often, **Dryad Militant** is a good option to use on White Winnie decks or that have green as well. Here I take the opportunity to bring the &gt;!second tip:!&lt; **if there are cards that you can use the most volatile form in your main deck strategy, explore this, Cling to Dust for example, it is less of a grave hate side that can go to the main, you can gain 3 life (great against aggros) or in the worst case you buy a card (note: you still have the Escape option).**

Another need for sideboard use this season is cards that break artifacts and / or enchantments. With several Affinitys working, every sideboard carries 2 to 4 hate of artifacts and enchantments, which can be one-off or global depending on your deck strategy. Among the most common and that can be used in more than one option are **Feed the Swarm**, **Return to Nature** and **Fracturing Gust**. In the line of artifact removal, we have: **Smash to Smithereens, Vandalblast, shenanigans,** and being global: **Granulate, Creeping Corrosion, Purify**.

This season we had the possibility to experience a very fast speed in the game, including, as we will see below, the archetype that has won more times and with more decks in the current goal, the Aggros have an Achilles heel that thanks to the gods, we obtained some low cost global removals: In red we have **Pyroclasm** and **Slagstorm**, in White, perhaps the most effective global removal of the format, **Day of Judgment.** In black some good removals are also strong like **Yahenni's Expertise**, **Drown in Sorrow**, **Ritual of Soot** and **Consume the Meek**.

![img](obliovdt22w51 " 
S18 archetypes, counting only tournaments up to 10/29")

As planeswalkers appearing on the side, we have **Dovin, Hand of Control**, **Teyo, the Shieldmage** and **Gideon Jura**, all focused on delaying or protecting until the development of the main strategy. &gt;!Third tip!&lt;: **Do not leave your main strategy to use side, there are decks like Merfolks that do not use serious hate for example because besides the deck being extremely fast, if a reanimate wants to make fun there are cost 1 bounces and cost 1 counters too.** 

And this 3rd tip brings a very interesting question, do not think about how to hinder the opponent, but how you get an advantage while developing your strategy. Examples: In a Burn deck the idea is to use direct damage on the opponent to kill him, if the player puts a lot of creatures you can end up dying faster or creatures with lifelink will also make you have problems, in this case **Satyr Firedancer** is a good choice of side, while you continue to deal direct damage, removing opponent creatures. Still in the red, I've seen decks using **Dragon's Claw** against mirrors because they can come to life by themselves and by the opponent's magic. 

Little explored ideas: Personally I like to test different things and some things that I managed to generate a lot of value and I don't see much used, were **Guerrilla Tactics** in a burn, since one of the options when someone takes the front is to use disposal to remove the resources. **Lightning Rift** on decks that use red when facing cyclings to use the opponent's resources against him. And lastly, my current side against cyclings and even some deck combos: **Uba Mask**, as the card will be exiled, it cannot be cycled. 

Well, in general, I believe that Penny ends up having a hard time creating a unique side, the format is not as static as others, which makes it even fun in my opinion. These are the most used cards, but there are countless others that are available. For this season I always follow this sideboard ratio and adjust for my deck strategy: 

* 3 to 4 cards to deal with Graveyard, removal. 
* 2 removal of artifacts and enchantments.
* 2 to 4 combos break.
* 2 to 3 creature removals and / or boardwipe.
* 3 or 4 life gain. 

Always remembering that there are cards that meet more than one of these options, and always respecting the game line of your deck. As a &gt;!fourth tip!&lt; **what helps me a lot is to do reverse engineering:** I usually get the decks that I have the most difficulty winning and use them in some test matches. Playing with the deck can you see where the callus grips, what are the difficulties, which loss of resource affects the most? This helps me both in choosing when building the side and when starting to choose which cards will come in and which will come out between games. 

To conclude with an aid in adapting the side, accompanied there as it was in the last week, that the decks are giving more work to be fought. 

\--- SUMMARY METAGAME OF THE WEEK ---

With a smaller participation of the players this weekend, we saw a dominance of the colors Izzet, with the Affinity piloted by the player BR ravage.pe that took 3 top1 and Izzet Drakes from Honourbound84 taking 1 top1 and 1 top2 added 4 of the 6 champions of this weekend. Another deck that appeared a lot was also the Reanimate turn 1 win appearing 4 times at the top. But in general the top8 were well sprayed, with few RDWs and Burns, Merfolks piloted by BR Shadowater0 made top1 again just like a UB Storm. Dredge, Mono Blue delver, esper control and Rakdos Aristrocatas appeared twice each:

I would really like to begin working my way into the a chase trifecta and would like to begin with the chase freedom flex due to the 5% revolving categories that I believe fits my wallet. That said, I have been doing some research and found that some people have suggested creating a checking or savings account with chase would help in the application process.

2020-10-29 16:12:03 : My Job is to Guide Others to the Afterlife : bstant7 : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jkcyp2/my_job_is_to_guide_others_to_the_afterlife/

 I guess I’ll start by saying hi. I haven’t really communicated with multiple people in a long time so I’m a little unsure how to go about it, but my name’s Dux and as the title suggests I’m what’s called a Reaper. There’s two tiers of reapers, one is the one most of you may be familiar with, the traditional “Grim Reaper”, where a soul dies and the reaper comes in to ferry it to Heaven or Hell and the second one, the one I am, is the lower tier. Essentially I live my life as a human would, but every couple weeks I have to guide a soul who was taken before their time. I’ll explain what this means more in a bit, but basically some are chosen to meet their eternity early. Basically a soul can become a reaper after they die and repent. I myself died right near the turn of the 20th century and have been at this for about a hundred years now. After two hundred I’ll get bumped up to Tier 2 and if you’re confused by my less than traditional name, Reaper’s get to choose their own name after their first ferry and I chose Dux which means Leader. I thought it was fitting, but I digress.

Back to the point. In Tier 1 the souls aren’t dead yet, but they have the choice to face a series of trials to get into Heaven or Hell. The reason I’m writing this post is because of my last ferry. In my hundred years of ferrying I’ve only had about 3 dozen souls, like I said this is a very very rare opportunity for souls, but this one was my youngest and something about it has stuck with me and I needed for someone to read this so that they know what’s possible and maybe if you’re one of the “lucky” chosen then you can be prepared or you at the very least know to turn back.

Abraham had just turned 14. I don’t know why he was chosen so early. If I had it my way this wouldn’t even be an option, but I don’t have a choice. I was placed with Abe, so the calling had to begin. It starts with dreams a few weeks before it’s time. The soul will start hearing their reaper’s voice calling out to them. It’s faint and really not noticeable at first when they’re awake, but it drowns out their dreams for days. Eventually their mind can make sense of the Enochian and that’s when it takes a turn.

As soon as they make the translation the gentle calls of their name turn into sounds of Hell and their dreams are overtaken by what could possibly await them. I always try to yell over the screams a simple mantra, “The path to Darkness is paved with gold, but Paradise lies beyond pain” but I really don’t know if it ever makes it through and the fact that before Abe I only had four people make it to Heaven makes me think it doesn’t.

During this time a reaper starts to, connect, with their soul. Essentially we start to feel what they’re feeling. Pain, Joy, Fear, really whatever they feel I start to feel. This helps us sympathize further and, allegedly, this is supposed to help more souls make it to Heaven, but again 4 have, so I think it’s bullshit. Anyway, this will go on for weeks until the soul is finally ready. By ready I mean they can barely sleep or function in general out of fear from the nightmares they’re experiencing and the voices they’re hearing throughout the day now. I hate that it comes to that, but eventually we can bring them to the path. 

Abe went to sleep that last night with peace. I could feel his bliss as he was finally able to rest his head on his pillow and listen to nothing but silence. As soon as they fall asleep I usually summon them, but I let Abe rest. It broke my heart that I had to bring him and I really wanted him to enjoy the last bit of peace that he ever might experience.

Eventually I relented and brought him to The Path. I stood at the entrance to the path as Abe stood with his back to me. I could instantly feel his fear more intense than ever. I felt fear that I hadn’t ever experienced from a soul. He shivered and shook violently from the freezing cold around us and his panic at standing alone in the pitch black. I looked at my own hands and realized I had started slightly shaking as well which was odd. I looked back at him with curiosity and snapped my fingers. Suddenly the path fully opened and the clearing we were standing in was bathed in light and warmth. I watched his shoulders relax and immediately felt his fear diminish. It wasn’t gone, but it was lessened for the time being. I tried to hold back a smile, but I couldn’t.

As he turned I could feel his joy rise and then the fear was back like never before. This was a normal step. Reapers take on the form of whatever soul they’re in charge of at the time, again this is supposed to make the transition easier or something, but I know when I saw my reaper it was the most terrifying moment of my life or afterlife. I kept the smile on my face to try and project a feeling of calm to the boy, but the connection’s only one way.

I beckoned for him to join me, but he didn’t move. Understandable. The fear I was feeling through Abe made my smile waver, but I fought through it as he started floated towards me. This is something we have to do sometimes and if any of you ever experience this it’s nothing to be ashamed of. This is a scary moment and sometimes your legs just don’t want to work. The way he kept eye contact with me while he floated was new though and a little off putting. I could feel that even with his fear he was a strong kid and was trying to maintain that on the outside, ready for anything I was about to throw at him. It gave me fleeting confidence in that moment. He had no idea what was waiting.

When Abe was about 3 feet from me he was lowered back to the ground. I gave him a second to run through the gambit of emotions that were normal for the situation and felt each one with him. He pushed right through disbelief and horror and settled almost immediately on dread. Again my smile fell momentarily as I shook from the strength of what he was feeling. I shook it off and cleared my throat, ““Hello Abraham. My name is Dux. I have the honor of being your guide on the final path. You may ask me anything you like.”

Abraham didn’t move. I could feel the tears coming before I saw them, “F...final path?” He stammered. I nodded slowly. “I’m only 14.”

I tried to maintain a cheery look, but had to blink my eyes to maintain composure. “Yes, you haven’t lived a long life, but some are given early release from the mortal plane to gain the chance to live forever in Paradise. Congratulations.” I know it sounds so stupid and cliche, but we basically have a script. As expected, Abe stood in silence so I cleared my throat again and continued, “I’m what’s called a reaper. I was once human and I wasn’t given this same opportunity so you truly are getting something special.” With that I could actually manage a real smile. Abe’s spirits lifted for a second when he heard he was special and that lifted the weight sitting on me for a moment.

That moment crumbled as Abe fell to his knees in tears. “But I don’t want to go. I’m only 14.” I reached a shaking hand out to touch his shoulder, but Abe pulled away, “I don’t want to go.”

I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. Most of my souls are middle aged or older and I can suppress their feelings easily. The one time I needed to maintain composure to calm this child and I couldn’t.

I took my time to collect myself. “I understand. Again I wasn’t given this opportunity I just died young and became a reaper to save myself from the darkness. This is a way for you to avoid the darkness.”

Abe sniffed and tried to compose himself. “If I have to do this, what do I have to do.” I could feel that strength bubble to the surface again. His confidence was at war with his fear and an involuntary smile spread across my face.

“It’s not going to be easy,” I began, “but you’ll endure a series of tests and depending on how you face them you will be placed in Paradise or be thrown to the darkness. After each test you can continue or leave the choice is yours.”

Abe took a couple breaths before responding, “What kind of tests?”

I sighed, “They get progressively worse. I can’t say exactly what they are, but it’s not going to be easy. Like I said, there is an exit after every one.”

I let the words hang in the air and felt him go through emotions so quickly I could barely feel them before the next one was there. “That being said. You can end this right now and go back to your life.” Abe looked up at me with curiosity and confusion. “You pass these trials and you make it to Heaven. If you don’t….you don’t. Or you can take your chance with life and hope everything works out in your favor.”

This new information sent his mind into overdrive. For a young kid he weighed the pros and cons with a level of maturity that most older souls don’t even have. He stood there in external silence for a while. I went to say something else, but he interrupted me, “Let’s fucking go.” He said it with such force that I couldn’t help but smile. This kid was infectious and I think I knew why he was chosen for this. I reached out my hand and after some hesitation led him through the trees behind me.

We walked in silence and I felt him trying to get a hold of his nerves, “What’s the first test?” He finally asked.  

“The first one is relatively easy.” I said while keeping my eyes straight ahead. “This is also the only one I can help you on. Do not look at anyone in this test. If you have to close your eyes, close them, I don’t care, just don’t look anyone in the eyes.”

Abe gulped, almost regretting asking the question, and continued in silence until we came upon a split in the path. “We’ve reached our first decision. Would you like to forgo the tests.” I said gesturing to the left path that had a bright golden glow to it, “Or would you like to endure.” I finished, waving my hand towards the right path that was shrouded in darkness. Faint moans could be heard through the black. Again don’t get on me about the cheese, it’s stuff I have to say.

“Let’s test it.” Abe said after a breath. I smiled, hoping desperately that he could feel me trying to be reassuring. The left path dimmed and we continued to the right. 

I left Abe in the darkness and moved to the end of the trial. I could see and feel everything he endured during each trial and I shook with his nervousness. “Good luck,” I yelled to him as the darkness lifted around him. 

Abe’s head immediately shot towards the sky and at first I could feel confidence start to take over. But then the test actually began. As soon as he took a step the air around him erupted into pained moans. I watched as the figures that I knew to be damned souls swarmed around him aimlessly. They weren’t going to do anything, unless he looked at them, hence my warning. He froze immediately and I could feel the fear start to grab hold. I silently cheered him on and eventually he took a deep breath and started moving again. It took all I had to not start cheering for the kid. I saw him bump off a few of the souls and stop each time consumed by fear. 

“Close your eyes.” I accidentally said out loud. I looked around quickly and then realized I’m always alone during these trials so are there even rules? I wasn’t even sure he heard me until he stopped a final time and closed his eyes. He brought his head down to face forward and I could feel his immediate relief as looking up was beginning to strain his neck. I took a deep breath and started feeling a bit better myself. He shook slightly as the moans grew louder as more souls filtered in from the trees and aimlessly wandered around him. He gulped and put out his hands and began on his way again.

He made his way through at a painfully slow pace, but as long as he made it through the timing didn’t matter. He eventually made it past the mass of bodies and I could feel his fear start to dissolve as the moans most likely were starting to die away the further he went. When he was about 100 yards from the end of the path he stopped. I didn’t know what was going on, but all of a sudden his eyes shot open. My heart dropped as he stared in my direction in confusion. He can’t see me or anything beyond this trial until it’s complete so when he opened his eyes all he saw was darkness at the end. 

I could feel his confusion turn to panic as he started frantically looking around, thankfully just side to side at first, but then to my horror he turned around. He grew completely still and couldn’t even shake from terror when he saw the grotesque, human-ish figures that he had just passed through bumping into each other and slowly moving back and forth. I don’t blame the kid as the naked wrinkly skinned creatures still give me the creeps after all this time. I held my breath and was frozen from his fear as one of the souls met Abe’s eyes.

The moaning stopped and the hoard turned in his direction in unison. Time seemed to freeze as everyone stood motionless. As soon as Abe took a step back the hoard let out horrifying screams and began to stream towards him at an unbelievable pace. To his credit, Abe didn’t let his crippling fear slow him down as he turned and sprinted in my direction with everything he had. I could feel his desperation and looked from him to the hoard that was rapidly gaining ground and back again. I could hear his panting and realized I was panting myself as I started screaming for him to hurry. Fuck the rules. 

The leading souls reached out and barely grazed his shirt as he got about 25 yards from me. I was all but reaching out my hand at this point. A chill went through my body as one of the souls dove and grabbed him around the ankle throwing him forward. His top half of his torso landed out of the trial and he looked up at me with panic, pleading with his eyes even though he was too afraid to speak. I hesitated for a split second too long and the hoard began dragging the child back into the trial. He kicked violently and let out a heart wrenching scream as the skin was starting to get torn from his calves. That was enough for me to reach down and drag the kid the rest of the way. 

As soon as his feet crossed the border everything behind us turned to black and we were left there with him sobbing softly on the ground and me, panting, standing over him. I could feel his pain and it crushed me. No kid should have to go through this. His sobbing slowly faded and I could feel relief start to overtake the desperation and fear he was feeling. 

I knelt down beside him and put my hands on his back. I was able to catch my breath, “I told you not to look at them.” I tried to say something light, but I’m not sure if that was the right thing as he shot around and stared at me.

He didn’t say anything but I knew he was angry. I sighed and helped him to his feet.

“Can I rest for a moment please?” He pleaded with me. 

“I’m sorry, but no. We have a while to go before the next trial and I promise you’ll be feeling better by then.” I was lying and I knew he knew it. He didn’t bother looking at me for a while or saying anything. I didn’t blame him and my own shame started to fight with his pain in my head.

We were almost near the second trial when he finally asked, “What the hell was that?”

I looked at him, but didn’t break stride, “That was the first test. Those were lost souls who refused to repent, but didn’t deserve the darkness. Basically they rot and turn into that. It’s like limbo I guess.” 

“Would that be me if they dragged me back?”

“No that would have been much worse.” I replied shortly. The less I talked it seemed to help me control his emotions that I was feeling so. 

I could feel fear suddenly spike in him and glanced over to see him looking towards the trees that lined the path around us. I knew he was looking at the dark silhouettes that stood in between the trees, but he didn’t ask and again I was trying not to speak as much, so we just kept walking. 

I stopped when we reached another fork in the path. “We have reached our second choice. Would you like to exit, or continue?” I asked, gesturing to both paths respectively. 

Abe didn’t hesitate, “Test.” I smiled proudly. The left path again was thrust into darkness  and Abe moved towards the right.

“Good luck Abraham.” I said before Abe walked into the darkness.

I took my spot at the end of the trial and watched nervously as the darkness lifted around Abe and he was immediately hit with a strong gust of wind forcing him to stagger and brace himself. I felt his fear for a split second, but he quickly regained his confidence as he was able to find his footing and slowly trek forward. Stumbling, I could feel his pain start to lift as the cold air and freezing winds numbed his raw legs.

The further along the path he trudged, the stronger the winds became and eventually he had to lean forward to brace himself. I could feel stabbing pain starting to creep back as the cooling effects of the wind started going in the opposite direction on the rest of his body, stinging his skin and eyes. This is one of the shortest trials, but probably takes the longest and the fact that after about half an hour he was only about 10 feet along was a great testament to that.

Eventually, as they all do, Abe leaned about as far forward as he could and stopped moving. I shook slightly from the cold that he was feeling on his own body, a sensation I hadn’t felt since my own penance. I attempted, pretty unsuccessfully to control my slight shiver. While I was focusing on myself, Abe laid down and started crawling with his eyes closed along the ground. I could feel his agony every time he dug his fingers into the almost frozen dirt. He was going a lot slower than standing, but he was moving at a more consistent pace than before. I felt a quick twinge of fear, but I think he was way too cold to feel or think anything. The winds continued to get stronger until he was about 10 feet away from me and I could see him start to slide backwards along the ground. He furiously flailed his hands in front of him and dug even deeper into the hard ground then before. 

He let out a scream of pain as I could see his fingernails start to lift off of his bloody hands. The progress was much slower and more excruciating, but inch by inch he came to the end. He let out one last defiant roar that sent shivers down my spine and pulled himself the last bit until the path grew dark and he laid on his back at my feet, shivering uncontrollably with his eyes closed. I knelt down next to him and could hear the faintest sobs as a tear forced its way out of his eyelid. My own eyes started to bubble slightly, but I rubbed then and put a hand on his shoulder.

“You’re doing amazing kid.” I tried to sound as reassuring and confident as possible, but my voice wavered a bit as his fear and pain overtook me. Abe opened his eyes and stared blankly at the black starless sky that hung above us. If you didn’t know any better you’d think we were in a bottomless pit with no hope of clawing our way to the surface and I could tell by his stone face still spanked with tears that he was feeling that emptiness and hopelessness.

He didn’t say anything for a long time and I let him sit with this. As his body thawed the pain returned to his legs and hands, but to the kid’s credit he didn’t show it. I could feel his internal agony, but his face was stoic. I looked at the blood streaming from his legs and noticed he was missing a few nails and could do nothing, but sigh. I wanted to pick the kid up and carry him, I wanted to help him along, but he needed to be strong to make it through and that wouldn’t help. 

After some time he looked at me and allowed me to help him to his feet. We moved along much slower than before in silence that was suddenly broken by screaming all around us. Abe surged with fear and looked around as a cold sweat started pouring down his face. “What is that?” he asked almost inaudibly, looking at the many more figures that were now standing in the trees.

I was too transfixed by Abe’s pain to remember the figures at first, but then I snapped out of it. I looked side to side without stopping our progress, “Those are souls that were lost to this particular test. They have to stay here for eternity and watch others try to succeed where they failed. That’s what would’ve happened if those creatures on test one had pulled you back or if you couldn’t make it past the winds. 

The screams were faint right now, but I knew it would get worse as we moved further in the tests. He was shaking in fear looking around us and was too preoccupied to realize we had gotten to the next fork. I didn’t even bother going through my whole thing this time and just nodded to him. 

Abe exhaled sharply. “Test.” he breathed out.

I gave his shoulder a squeeze. “You can make it through this Abraham.” I pulled the kid in and kissed the top of his head. “Good luck.”

As soon as the darkness lifted ice hit Abe’s head without warning. A tremendous hail was pouring down on him from above. He didn’t hesitate this time. As soon the cold from this test numbed his raw legs and nailless fingers and he used that to his advantage. I watched with a tentative smile as Abe waited for the cold to take it’s hold and began to sprint as fast as he could. The hail grew worse as he moved until I knew there was just a wall of white pain in front of him, but he never broke stride and closed his eyes.

The more he ran the more confidence I could feel surge in him, but I couldn’t share the feeling and as soon as a terrible roar cut through the almost deafening sound of hail that confidence was shattered and he stopped in his tracks. His eyes shot open and then back to a squint as he frantically looked around trying to identify the source of the sound, eventually landing on the giant 3-headed creature perched on a throne overlooking the trial. I knew Cerberus wasn’t a threat, but I was hoping he didn’t shake Abe long enough to impede his progress on this trial.

To my relief Abe slowly continued on again without taking his eyes off the motionless figure. His senses were heightened now and the pain from the hail was starting to make it’s way to the surface. Without warning Abe turned back towards me, closed his eyes and sprinted faster than ever. One last roar tore through the air and chased him out, but the path grew dark and Abe stood in front of me, hunched over and panting.

I could feel the stinging on his skin and couldn’t tell if his slight shiver was from the cold or pain, but I put my hand on his back. “That was fast man.” I said with a sense of pride taking over. “Honestly one of the fastest I’ve seen in my time.”

He looked up at me, still trying to catch his breath and wordlessly just gestured for us to move on. This is one of the first times in years I felt genuine joy. This kid was strong. I held him back for a second and looked him in the eyes. “It may not seem like it, but you’re doing really good right now.” I looked for confirmation in his eyes or anything, but I could feel his lack of confidence and it hurt. I bit my lip and sighed. We both looked down and saw the massive collection of welts that joined his torn legs and hands. He started trembling and tearing up as he watched the blood pour down his shins and over his destroyed shoes. I could feel his regret and my stomach began to hurt.

I put my arm around his shoulders and began leading him down the path. I went to say something hopefully reassuring, but he interrupted me, “What the hell is a reaper anyway?”

I was a little taken aback by the question. Not that I don’t get asked, because I do, but I usually get asked much much earlier in the process. “Well the short version is we ferry souls.” He cringed a bit as the screaming began around us. I wasn’t going to continue, but I knew the kid needed a distraction for a second. “When we die some of us are given this option as penance for our sins. We spend a few hundred or thousand years ferrying souls depending on our sins and then go to Heaven.”

He didn’t react to anything I was saying and I knew he didn’t care. I wasn’t feeling anything from him which was new. I think he was trying to numb himself. Smart.

We came up to the next fork and before I even attempted to speak he yelled, “Right!”

I sighed and nodded slowly. I didn’t bother with the good lucks this time and he didn’t look at me, just walked into the darkness.

The darkness lifted and Abe looked curiously at the large boulder that stood in front of him. He was still numbing himself but I could feel curiosity start to peak through. I smirked at the fact that he wasn’t afraid. Even when he saw the tiny goblin like creatures standing around the boulder excitedly jumping around and screeching to themselves the stupid language they speak, he was just curious and nothing else. I saw him flinch in pain as his injuries began to take their toll again. He closed his eyes and hung his head, clenching his fists trying to control himself. 

As he looked down the goblins hopped over and dragged him towards the boulder. They strapped a chain around his waist and excitedly laughed and jumped their way back into the trees. His eyes were still closed and he didn’t move for a while. I was growing more nervous as I felt the pain radiate worse than ever before. 

I gave him a few more minutes, trying to suppress the pain that now surged throughout my body. “Fucking go kid!” I managed to scream.

This seemed to break his trance and his eyes shot open, looking in my direction a few hundred yards away. He stumbled forward until the rope was taut and stopped. He turned towards the boulder and took a few deep breaths, grabbing the chain with both hands. He yanked as hard as he could and the boulder moved a couple inches. “Fuck.” I could hear him mutter, resigned.

This trial wasn’t that hard, but it was grueling. Honestly after this one a lot gave up, if they even made it this far and this is what I feared for Abe. I held my breath, silently cheering for him. Out of nowhere I felt a wave of confidence over take him as he took his time moving the massive stone. I knew he still felt the pain all over his body, but slowly, very slowly he inched forward. He stopped when the pain was too much, but after maybe 10 yards or so his body began to numb and he could continue on. With the pain gone in his legs he could drive forward with more power and moved a bit faster, but after about half a day of pulling I could feel his confidence wavering.

To my disappointment he first sat and then laid down, basically giving up. I was heartbroken. I hung my head and just waited for him inevitably to just pass on. I sat staring at him not knowing what to do besides playing with the dirt in front of me. We sat like that for 20 minutes or so when out of nowhere he sprung to his feet and I could feel fear surge through him. I didn’t know what had prompted this but I was all for it. I jumped up as well and started yelling for him.

He turned his back to me again and pulled and didn’t stop pulling this time. I could feel the strain and watched him dig his heels into the ground and pull with everything he had. He let out a few screams and inched his way towards me. His confidence overtook the fear as he moved closer and closer until after a full day was almost at the end of the trial. I reached across the barrier and my hand started burning painfully. I pulled back surprised. I never tried to help a soul before.

I hesitated and swallowed as his progress had slowed. I took a deep breath and jumped onto the path. The searing pain forced me to let out a scream that startled Abe, who turned to me and jumped back. I screamed again and grabbed his chain. I saw smoke coming from my arms as we both pulled the last few feet and felt immediate relief when we made it to the other side.

This time we both slumped over and panted. I caught my breathe first and my body had already started healing so the burns that had formed on my arms were closing themselves. I let out a little laugh, “I’m not doing that again.” I said with a smile and looked up at him, but he wasn’t looking back.

He looked worse than before and now on top of the crippling pain, I could feel his utter exhaustion. I limped over to him and put a hand on his shoulder. He wasn’t crying, but I knew he wanted to. “If you want to stop, I can carry you.” I bent down and whispered in his ear.

He took a couple more seconds and a sinking feeling began forming in my gut. I wanted him to refuse, but I’ve seen this look before, when a soul is done, they’re done. The longer he took to answer or even look at me the worse I felt. With him responding I went to lift him, but he slapped me away. “I’m not done yet.” He said looking at me with fire and determination that I wasn’t expecting. Another shiver went down my spine and I beamed with pride. 

I grabbed his hand and helped him get fully upright. “You got this kid.” I said pulling him in for an embrace.

His words and eyes gave off confidence and defiance, but I could feel his resignation and fear. I held him for a long time trying my best to let him heal as best I could. We pulled away and began on our way. The screams were louder now than ever and it was pointless to even try talking. It was better at this stage to conserve energy anyway and soon we were to the next fork. 

I didn’t ask or gesture. I didn’t need a response because I knew our journey together was going to continue. Faint splashing could be heard from the dark right path and I saw him hesitantly look at the shining gold path to the left. He took a couple deep breaths and moved to the right, into the darkness.

I took my normal place at the end of the trial and was pleased to see my friend Nuntius standing there waiting for me. “Dux!” he yelled when he saw me and we embraced. “It’s been too long, I’m sorry that we’re meeting again though.”

I sighed and told him I shared his sentiments. When the pleasantries were finished we stared at each other in silent pity for a few moments. “How is yours.” I finally asked.

He sighed, “He’s a good guy of course, they all are. But he doesn’t have the strength, I know,” He let out a deep, sad sigh, “this is his last trial.” 

I clapped a hand on my friend’s shoulder, “I’m so sorry. Thankfully this is your last ferry?”

I saw his lips quiver trying to smile, but it wouldn’t come. “I would’ve liked to end it by bringing another soul to paradise, but take it from an old veteran, watching good people suffer is still part of the penance.”

We touched foreheads and stayed silent for a few moments with our eyes closed before I whispered. “My kid is strong.”

Our eyes opened and I continued, “He’s one of the strongest I’ve had, he’s young, but worthy.” Nuntius weakly smiled and gave me a knowing nod. “I’m truly sorry for this.” 

We put our arms around each other and looked at the trial.

Abe stood on one side of a narrow, decrepit, wooden path sitting about 35 feet above a raging river. On the opposite side of the path stood a man of about 50 who looked to be in worse shape than my Abraham. I looked at Nun and he nodded reluctantly. We turned back and the man looked horrified while I could see and feel Abe’s curiosity as he looked at the tall black waves that almost reached his pier, flinching ever so slightly everytime a skinny, decayed hand reached out looking for anyone to raise them from their fate.

Abe eventually looked back to the man who was still shaking and looking around in fear. Abe did nothing as the man finally looked to him and they both stood there in confusion, neither knowing what to do. Out of seemingly nowhere during their stare there was a large crack of lightning and in each of their hands an old rusty sword and old wooden shield appeared. I felt Nun tense up in my grasp as the two froze in place as a sense of shock overtook Abe and I knew he knew what was going on. 

Nervously he looked up to the man, who was staring at the sword and shield with a mixture of fear and shock. I held my breath as Abe looked from the sword to the man and back and then slowly made his way to the other side of the walkway. The man looked up and saw Abe approaching and lifted his sword, but didn’t move. Abe picked up speed as he ran forward and let out a scream before swinging down so violently that both Nuntius and I jumped back. The man blocked with his shield but was thrown back to the edge of the walkway.

Abe didn’t let up and dropped his shield to use both hands to swing down over and over and over onto the man’s shield. I could see tears filling his eyes and could feel how afraid he was in this moment. The man kicked him in the gut sending the small child flying back and they once again stood staring at each other as the waves below grew higher and higher, starting to soak the moldy, broken boards upon which the two souls sparred. They both let out screams and ran towards each other, swords cocked back ready to strike. Neither were very skilled and simply swung at each other trying desperately to hit something fleshy. 

Abe landed the first blow, stabbing the man in the gut. He let out a small cry of pain, but didn’t let up on the much smaller soul. Swinging overhead relentlessly eventually getting Abe with a good jab to the shoulder. The child screamed and dropped his sword off the edge of the platform into the dark water below as a thick stream of blood started pouring out of him. I winced and closed my eyes and only opened them when I felt my friend’s hand squeeze my shoulder. 

Through watery eyes I watched in terror as the kid fell to his back and started crawling backwards away from the man. I fell to my knees as the tears ran down his face and could barely make out his pleas of mercy over the raging waves. Nun knelt down next to me and embraced me hard. We both knew how hard this was and I know he was not enjoying my misery.

Abe scrambled backwards as quickly as he could as the man slowly followed him and raised his sword above his head,  bringing it down hard onto Abe’s blocking arm, making a clean cut and sending the severed limb tumbling over the edge. Abe and I both let out heart wrenching screams as I completely fell to the ground and he stopped scrambling, holding his severed appendage. The man had tears running down his face and I felt Nuntius lean in close to my ear. “He’s sorry.” 

Abe was rolling in pain as the blood soaked the platform around him. The man hesitated, he was a good man after all, but then raised his sword for one final swipe. As he brought the blade down the waves finally reached the platform and one of the lost souls in the water found what it was looking for as a decaying hand grabbed the man’s ankle and dragged him, screaming in terror into the waters below.

Nuntius and I both sat there, stunned. We had never seen a soul be grabbed. We knew what swam in the Styx, but had never seen them grab another soul. I could still barely stand as Abe now lay writhing in pain, still clutching his severed arm on solid ground. Nuntius let out a breath and looked from Abe and back to me. 

He didn’t say anything and he didn’t have too. I nodded my head as my eyes began to tear. He stood up and began to walk away, “I hope to see you in the next phase my friend.” I called weakly after him.

He turned and smiled to me, nodding before disappearing into the trees.

I weakly crawled over to Abe who was crying silently on the ground as his arm bled. I didn’t say anything at first and laid next to him, not able to take his pain, but just feel it. I wanted to take it. I wanted to take him back and make him go back to his life. It was too late.

I managed to get to my feet and he still didn’t open his eyes or move. All he did was whisper, “Please carry me.” Through tears.

I let out an exasperated sigh and nodded, trying to catch my breath before I reached down and scooped up his body. His blood poured down on me as we trudged along slowly and the screaming souls were silent. I felt tears form in my eyes and for the first time since my own penance they dripped down my face onto the motionless figure that I carried. 

I was shaking as we finally got to the fork for the 6th trial. I went to speak but was stopped by the sobs that I thought were from Abe but realized were coming from me. I began again as my tears soaked my face. “I don’t care that I carried you. You can continue.” I looked down at the young face all but pleading with him to continue onto the Light.  

He looked at me and, coughing up blood, smiled, “No more tests Dux.” I fell to my knees and dropped him to the ground. I sobbed uncontrollably as he struggled to his feet and turned to hug me, “Thank you.”

“I...I’m so sorry Abraham.” was all I could muster as I watched the child slowly walk towards the golden path to the left. 

“The path to Darkness is paved with gold, but Paradise lies beyond pain.” I heard him lightly chant to himself as he moved.

I smiled slightly as he crossed the barrier and I watched and felt as his severed arm grew back and felt all his pain vanish as joy filled his heart. He paused just beyond the barrier and I could feel a surge of fear overtake him. I couldn’t see what he was seeing but he turned back screaming and ran towards me before the darkness consumed him and he was gone.

I… I don’t have a choice, but to continue with the path that I’ve chosen. I don’t have a choice but to try and be a better ferryman to those who decide to take this path. But please, please  if you are given the chance, turn back and live your life, take your chances.

2020-10-29 16:12:18 : What are considered non fast paced jobs that are professional? : Madeline2853 : https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jkcyv8/what_are_considered_non_fast_paced_jobs_that_are/

People suggest, "just apply here, there's a help wanted sign."

Why dont people ever engage in a discussion about the math.

The net income, and how that covers a budget to live on.

I need a certain income to meet my expenses, including housing, car and healthcare.

But I've had people say, "don't worry about what it pays, some money is better than no money."

What if you cant work a 2nd job, but can work 7am to 5pm.

But the job pays $12.00 hour pretax

I was told I have to disregard my finance and masters degrees and that some money is better than no money,  even if it doesnt qualify me for housing and would only cover my car, past due bills, phone, food and medications but not housing.

I want to focus on the math.

$12.00 is $10.00 net

$10/hour = $400 week or $1,600

Healthcare $200/month
Car $300/month plus $100 insurance
$200 gas

$400 food, miscellaneous, hygiene products, laundry, car maintenance 

$65 phone

Need money for:
Housing $
Grad loan which has to be paid $
Medical and dental copayments $
Clothing replacement if necessary $
Credit card balance $125 min month pmt

How much do you need to live on to cover those expenses above?

People say "any job is better than no job."

Okay, how do I meet the above expenses, and still be cheerful and chipper in my work, working calmly and composed, under pressure without showing signs of anxiety or stress.

2020-10-29 16:12:18 : Recommend Me - First New Knife : wtellis2 : https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/comments/jkcyv3/recommend_me_first_new_knife/

 Hello all!  After spending a couple of hours delving through this subreddit, I figured it was time to get a recommendation.  I have been using hand-me-down knives for most of my "adult" life (at 26, I still find that term debatable at best), and even though I have taken relatively good care of them, I am on the hunt for a more reliable chef's knife.  I have settled on a western/German knife largely due to a need for the more versatile of the two styles, but also won't be using it as a cleaver (will be using an older knife and/or a pair of kitchen shears for tasks like spatchcocking a chicken).  I am not in any rush on this, but would like to take advantage of some of the deals that theoretically will be appearing for Black Friday, so any recommendations from the larger community would be greatly appreciated!

1. Style? - Western.  I know that this subreddit really advocates for a Japanese knife, and I think that is something that will be added to the collection/repertoire down the line, but for what I want out of a knife, it feels like the western/German style will be much better as a workhorse.
2. Steel?  - Stainless.  
3. Handle? - Probably western, but am more open to the alternative here.
4. Grip? - Pinch.  Developed a bad habit of using the handle grip on cheaper knives in the past, trying to grow out of that.  
5. Length? - 210 mm; but could be talked into something longer.
6. Uses? - Everyday usage.  Looking for a workhorse.
7. Care? - Any of the three.  There is a local paid service in town that does exceptional work and offers a great rate.  Have used him in the past, but will eventually transition into doing the honing work myself.  
8. Budget? Somewhere in the $100-$150 range, wouldn't object to something a bit higher but would like to stay away from the $200+ range for now.

2022-08-15 11:12:44 : Can they remain friends? : LowerFarm9856 : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wowwtm/can_they_remain_friends/

Me (28F) and my husband (30M) have been together 13 years and were just recently in a open marriage. While it was open he started catching feelings for this woman and also had sex with her multiple times. Which was fine because we were in a open marriage. But after he expressed to the woman that he had strong feelings for her. She rejected him and said she doesn't see him that way. And that she could never be in a relationship with him. She only sees him as a friend. After she told him that he was hurt and I had to help him through it. But even after all that he wants to remain friends with her. And he wonders why I'm pissed about the situation. Is it petty of me to think that since this woman rejected him that they should not remain friends if he's trying to get over his feelings for her? Also we closed our marriage due to personal reason. And he would still like to remain friends with her.

2022-08-15 11:12:38 : Scheduled Zola’s spay, now I’m nervous. : Linyela : https://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/wowwrj/scheduled_zolas_spay_now_im_nervous/

So I finally got around to plan Zola’s (1 year old) spay for September 5th and I’m already nervous for it. I found a vet clinic with 2 vets that specialize in bunnies and they, as well as the assistant staff, keep their knowledge up to date (they most recently had a “Rabbit welfare &amp; Ethics Update” and a “Rabbit reproductivedisease and how to neuter” course). On the phone they told me they use techniques that will check for her breathing and heart rate throughout the surgery, and are also able to manually give her oxygen when it comes to it. The surgery itself is also done on a heating pad, so that the bunny doesn’t cool down during the surgery. They also told me to prepare a lunch bag for her, which is what I was planning to do anyway, with her hay, pellets and any other favorite food she may have. So I’m convinced Zola will be in the right hands.

I can already pick up some medication tomorrow as they want you to have it with you before surgery. I’ve taken care of bunnies with GI stasis before (unfortunately a bit too often as my previous bun was sick often due to damage e.c. did to her at 6 months old), so I know how to give the meds and force feed her. I’ve often set up alarms every 3 hours throughout the night to check and feed when my bun was sick. Zola herself never had any health issues and never showed any signs of not wanting to eat, not even when I first brought her home, she settled in right away and immediately flopped to sleep on her first day here.

However, I’m extremely nervous and I’m so scared something will go wrong and I’ll lose her, or that I’ll end up doing something wrong myself. So I guess I’m looking for some tips, experience from you all, or just comfort to get me through the day when she has her spay.

Thank you all in advance!

2022-08-15 11:12:53 : alone with boyfriends parents/family : stupidslinky : https://www.reddit.com/r/dutch/comments/wowwxa/alone_with_boyfriends_parentsfamily/

I'm (22f) currently at my boyfriends (32m) parents place  and he's gone to work (he works in the office on mondays). They speak little English and I'm only on about 40 crowns on duolingo, I know a few random words/phrases that I've picked up like winkel and donker etc. 

This is the second time meeting them and we're at their place for a few days. I'm from England by the way. Anyway, I'm alone and he told me to go down and eat and play with the kids (his 2 nieces are here, they're about 1 and 3). 

He told me to just go downstairs and chill and eat. Isn't it awkward to just go downstairs and sit there in silence since we have no way of communicating? I feel awkward using Google translate unless I really need to, and it's the first time I'll be alone with his family. More of his family members are coming over about an hour before he comes home from work and I have no idea how to act/interact with them because of the language barrier and just being a bit anxious since it's the first time.

Any ideas on what to do/say, how to act

Feels like I can't catch a break no matter what I do. I have a history of being late to work because I can't sleep at night due to general night terrors and exhaustion. I've lost jobs in the past due to this and I think I'm close to getting axed at my current job because of it as well. I've really been trying my best to keep it in check and have been doing a fairly alright job at it lately, but of fucking course does my key have to break in my apartment door lock the night before I'm expected to get alot of work to do and I couldn't get it open until around 5am and only because of sheer luck. Resulting lack of sleep got me an hour late to work and the call I got from my boss did not go well at all. It feels like I'm pretty much a lost cause when it comes to actually being a functional adult since I can't even hold a job. I'm afraid that I'll just give up entirely if I fuck this up again. I dunno who would hire someone who has 3 jobs on their resume without a single good reference. I don't think I'll ever be able to actually lead a normal life without having to worry daily if I'll fuck my life up again and I don't know how much of this constant anxiety I can take. My future just feels like I'll either end up homeless or I'll do something more permanent. I can't keep living like this but I can't fix it

2022-08-15 11:13:32 : First vacation without my ex, and it's hard to not unblock him : Consistent_Ad5790 : https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/wowxcg/first_vacation_without_my_ex_and_its_hard_to_not/

I had to dump my ex of one year around 2 months ago, because of our toxic tendencies in our relationship (especially emotional manipulation). The stress back then got so much, and towards the end I didn't feel like there was any other option anymore but to leave him, also because he started to put me down constantly.

It really was necessary, yet now that I'm going on vacation alone, the nostalgia on our good times hits pretty bad. And also because we were in a LDR, the fact that I'm getting on a train without him "waiting for me on the other side" is really sad to me. Especially now at late summer, I remember the feelings I had exactly a year ago, I really miss it so heavily. My grudges on him are vanishing again currently.

I know that my head looks at that past with rose-colored glasses again, yet I really haven't had such a good time with anyone but him in years, and now giving all that happiness only to myself again is just so hard. 

I wish I could just text him "Hey, I really miss you and going on vacation without you just feels so weird. I hope after some time we could get in touch again, when we feel ready." But I definitely won't. The fact that one part of me wants to get back together with him makes me sick. 

After thinking a lot about it, we definitely were codependent, stuck in the karpman triangle and therefore both of us were toxic in some ways, I definitely won't say that he was the only one with flaws. 
I was way too clingy, didn't know what to do without him, tried to change him and mostly only looked at "our potential" instead on the current. I basically adapted almost all of his opinions without question and didn't care for myself anymore, also while being overly concerned with his health. 
He on the other hand didn't really bother to actually get to know me (in a whole year he refused to visit my hometown, always had different reasons for it), pressured me into stuff I didn't really wanted to do (though not sexually atleast, thank god), sometimes gaslit me into thinking that my opinions are invalid and naive. We had a huge age gap as well.

And my that one corner of my mind wants to get back. Wants the drama. Wants the instant satisfaction over the long term. Now misses him like crazy when getting on the train. Ahh.

But yeah. I know I will get through it.
Maybe someone has had similar experiences? How did you manage missing your ex while on vacation?

Part 1/3: Setting -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsphere/comments/wncq44/how\_niheis\_worldbuilding\_doesnt\_fit\_the\_kind\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsphere/comments/wncq44/how_niheis_worldbuilding_doesnt_fit_the_kind_of/)

&amp;#x200B;

While the ending is quite rushed there is a lot going on theme wise that gives some real depth to the story. It’s a shame that Nihei wasn’t able to explore them further with the space they needed. 

Titania is the name of the fairy queen in Shakespeare, and in Aposimz she comes from a mysterious place, the core, and it turns out she manages the lives of the people there. At one point some wanted a less safe life, but this goes against Titania’s programming so, in another common Nihei theme, they were made exempt from protection and left for the surface. So, the way people live in Aposimz, so focused on surviving, Was the kind of life the people who originally left the core wanted. Considering Titania says people tried to get back to the core many times indicates their progeny didn’t agree with this. 

With this in focus, because of the disconnection between the protagonists and the world, and the way the world is explored, this theme of survival and lack of wellbeing isn’t driven home as much as it could be. The approach taken feels more touristy and so the themes that will be added in the ending won’t *feel* like the added dimension they are. 

The people of the core, apparently due to population control (why this is needed is unspecified) would not accept the now exiled people on the surface, or their progeny, coming to the core. However, according to Titania, they could be convinced to let them in if the surface dwellers became useful in some way, like if one had the ability to see the future, e.g., the emperor, Suou.

Titania had saved Suou, from frame disease (his sister had already succumbed) and became a regular frame with the ability to see the future. He saw his death, killed by someone at Titania’s request, and became obsessed with avoiding it, creating the empire in his attempts. There is a good idea here: something very personal and basic creating something large and impersonal (unfortunately it doesn’t feel an adequate motivation by the end). His status as a villain comes from his high priority for his own life over all those killed by, without and within, the empire (and allowing everyone in it to die because he was so focused on avoiding his death). Somehow, he is forgiven at the end (Titania probably just finds his powers that useful).

Both the core church and the empire are trying to find a kind of salvation from the surface. For the church, despite its leader exploiting its followers, they believe killing everyone will return them to the core, sending them to a better afterlife (despite being a fake religion this is factually correct); for the empire, it’s ideology of ‘regaining the rights of the control level’ is also a kind of searching for salvation form their current life - breaching heaven for its plenty (and causes needless suffering for an unnecessary goal which if achieved would destroy all of Aposimz); Suou’s motivation fits with this: he thinks there is no afterlife and so seeks to live forever, fighting against what is essentially the settings God who permits evil to exist on the surface world (and only acts against the god who saved him because his future sight can’t see into the afterlife).

This salvation and afterlife theme is interesting, and implicit in each of these motivations is the idea of quality of life, a theme which submerges desire for afterlife with even more texture. In this context I find the people who left the core’s motivation most interesting. It reminds me of George Orwell thinking  technology would make life worse because people will stop doing things if they lack necessity. He doesn’t seem to understand how people would go do a thing because they enjoy it or learn a skill for fun when a machine could do the task better. 

Nihei seems to like villains who seek immortality, he has said he wants to be immortal, but Suou feels a bit similar to the villain in Sidonia, and as a motivation it doesn’t seem grand or deep enough to fit with the large scale of the ending, nor is it framed right to feel the shell of an impersonal institution around a basic drive taken to selfish extremes. In the current framing it feels kind of petty. 

I feel like there is an interesting motivation nearby: If the oneshot is cannon, after going to the Core Suou feels the, presumably, pleasant life of people there lacks meaning. All the activities lack necessity, why do such meaningless things as they lack some greater purpose, like surviving. Perhaps he starts to think meaning comes from suffering. This would add a moralising element to the empire’s institutions, even if it’s members don’t realise it. All the suffering and death caused creates meaning in the lives it affects, at least in Suou’s head. As Titania also likely saved his sister, perhaps he thinks he is saving her from a meaningless existence by trying to break into the core. 

If this was the case, we have three large scale players, with Suou carrying similar beliefs to the people who originally left for the surface, trying to save people from heaven; the Core Church, with accidentally true beliefs, led by a banal villain bent on vengeance; and Titania and pals, trying to stop mass death (before Titania can find someone with an ability useful to the core). Then we have the lower-level factions: The Empire, which has an interesting mix of horrible and honourable people, subjecting those outside, and newly inside (An interesting thing to note: the empire forcibly includes, while the core forcibly excludes), to copious amounts of violence, and those within to, normally, softer violence(incentives to make children for the grinder); the empires unexplored institutions (science, citizenry); Jate; and the scattered populations desperately trying to survive. 

There is so much in the ending, so much needed to be known earlier to get the feeling of depth and meaning that is lurking here. For example: Titania refers to the staging ground as ‘this realm’ and says that things in it can “…be materialised in the physical world.” (Implying that the regular frames were caused, or allowed to exist, by Titania to generate some very useful power so she could make an argument to eventually let them back in) This feels like an idea you could play with. Have Keisha die earlier, or at the same point but continue the manga for the two or more volumes it desperately needed, so she can try to do something over there to affect the surface\*; talk to someone from the core, see if it is a better life; find Suou’s sister (what does she think of all of this?); have one of the reincarnated of the core church die (What’s her reaction to this place? and as the reincarnated seem to have a different mind, or at least identity, to the ones they had before having frame disease, is the person who died of frame disease already there? What do they think of one another?); etc. But then again, I don’t know what Nihei would have done if he had of had more time.

In summary, Nihei has good and interesting ideas, even very interesting themes, but as he has tries to make his work more appealing to the mainstream he hasn’t managed to properly integrate the change in style to his interests: by not making good use of elements of his setting for the style of story he is now writing, not knowing how to integrate characters and setting while making proper use of the character traits they have, and making the themes felt and well explored (though much of this last one is because of the truncated ending). There is much missed potential and it’s because some of his tropes don’t, or aren’t being made to, function in this new storytelling context. However, having said this I feel the need to point out that missed potential is not the same as bad. It just means it could have been better. Many people on the internet often seem prefer something without potential to something with failed potential because they find it frustrating. I personally don’t. Missed potential is about something that doesn’t exist, not what is there, and I enjoyed what was there. As I said at the start, I like Aposimz and love its art. 



\* In chapter 19 Etherow and Kaisha see objects in the landscape that they think they have passed by before. Titania calls it ‘deformation’ and says it has something to so with the Emperors abilities. The idea seems to have been dropped, but perhaps that could tie in here somehow?

I feel like everyone moans about their job but omg I just want to lock the shop and run away.

My depression is getting worse, and today at work I feel like I’m going to snap, for context I run a charity shop so I am the only paid member of staff in the rest our volunteers, so managing them is different, in half an hour, I have a volunteer with special needs in and he’s so lovely but I don’t have the energy to deal with him, I love him but it takes a lot of work and I’ve been crying all morning and I’m more terrified I’m going to snap at him. 

It’s not just my job, my whole life feels like it’s crashing and no matter who tells me it’s not I can’t stop feeling like it and I don’t know what to do, talking therapy didn’t work, my medication doesn’t seem to be working, I just want to run away. I get very depressed about my lack of money (again work for charity don’t get paid well and I live in one of the most expensive areas in the UK) and I’ve been trying for a year to get out and get a better paying job but no where wants me because I don’t have “admin” experience, tho I’ve taken classes to show I have the knowledge, and trust me if I run a whole shop relying on volunteers, not having regular stock etc I can do your boring office job just imputing data!!! So frustrating!! 

I just feel hopeless, worthless, stupid and like there’s no point in carrying on tbh

I just learned about this sub, and honestly didn't think other people had dreams like this. 
I have dreams that almost always take place in the same fake town. One of the locations in my fake town is some kind of gigantic mall, with tons of stores, restaurants, and various other attractions. There is a college/dorm building that seems like a giant apartment complex with tons of rooms and open lounge areas. Theres a school that is basically a cross between my real world middleschool and highschool, with tons and tons of classrooms and halls that down actually exist. 
These dreams never fail to intrigue me, because they always feel so real and vivid, like I'm simply living in a different world when I sleep.

2025-02-19 23:16:51 : Vet prices in your area? : DrSkipmonkey : https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itjqvp

I have a marvelous vet but the bills are really high. I see people here posting much lower costs. For example:

In 2020 a neuter cost $300. The last one was $600 in summer. We got a quote for $700 today. 

Euthanasia has been running $250.

Office visits are about $150 without medication.

There is one other exotic vet in town but they’re not as good and cost the same. Our vet works with us to minimize visits, but it’s really been adding up lately.

We’re in Eugene, Oregon. I suspect vet prices are just high here. PNW people are crazy about their pets.

What are you paying?

2025-02-19 23:16:49 : There's a lot of internalized misogyny in the 90daysfiance Reddit community : StrategicGlowUp : https://www.reddit.com/r/90dayfianceuncensored/comments/1itjqup/theres_a_lot_of_internalized_misogyny_in_the/

I see a lot of women commenting that Jasmine is too old to be having a child (38 years old) but on the same breath complaining about her not having a baby with Gino (54 years old).

There is growing evidence that advanced paternal age is associated increased susceptibility in children to a range of conditions.

A woman is born with all the eggs she’ll ever have. But a man is constantly making new sperm cells that divide and replicate about every 16 days. By age 20, a man’s sperm cells have gone through about 150 divisions. That number could grow to 800 by the time he is 50.

The more times sperm cells replicate, the more chances there is for a genetic mutation to occur. 

Examples of genetic conditions that have been associated with advanced paternal age include some skeletal dysplasias or dwarfism syndromes. These include achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism, and thanatophoric dysplasia. Some types of craniosynostosis syndromes have also been associated with advanced paternal age. These cause the premature fusion of bones in the skull, which affects head shape, and include Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, and Apert syndrome.

These conditions are caused by genetic variations (or mutations) in specific genes. They are sometimes inherited but can also occur sporadically and unpredictably. One factor correlated with this sporadic genetic variation in some cases is paternal age.

Just because men can have a child at an advanced age doesn't mean they should. If you are going to shame Jasmine for having a baby at 38 years old which is not even that bad, Gino thinking about having a baby at 54 years old, should be the issue here. But I don't see a lot of people talking about it.

Having a baby in your 50s is selfish and inconsiderate.

2025-02-19 23:16:47 : [ANNOUNCEMENT] MegaPatch 3.1 will release in the next 48 hours and will feature a NEW F4L GAMEPLAY via SIDER. : xGondowan : https://www.reddit.com/r/SPFootballLife/comments/1itjqu1/announcement_megapatch_31_will_release_in_the/

After all your feedback, we did an extra step.

As you may know, F4L 4.4 was included in the two previous versions of MegaPatch. All the praise and great reviews got the gameplay to the top of the world for this game... but was it good enough?

Negative feedback was that higher difficulties went to unfair to fairly easy, like deleting all that script was too much, and when you got used to the gameplay it was literally a birthday party.

F4L and I never stopped talking about what to maximize and push the boundaries about this game. He wasn't pleased enough with F4L 4.4 behaviour in FL25 because it wasn't that good as FL24, probably caused by FL25 EXE changes that, as you also may know, can affect the gameplay and also the gameplay differs from original PES 2021 as it is a different version (1.1.0.0 vs 1.7.0.2 latest official PES 2021). That's why all the Holland/Alex/etc gameplays don't fully work as intended here in FL25.

The goal this time was about getting more difficulty overall, but not at the cost of responsiveness, fun and CPU behaviour, as those are the three pillars of any gameplay base in case you want to get a better gameplay out of this game. That's why F4L got pen and paper with all those past values and started experimenting again out of that sadness he got about the F4L 4.4 unconsistent experience. He's playing EA FC 25 and designed pretty good sliders, but he still plays FL25 as he loves it more. We'll call this gameplay F4L REVISED version from now on.

Another of the big issues were that while some part of the F4L gameplay saga worked pretty well with standard tactics, the behaviour was different when Klashman tactics were applied. Stamina drain was one of those (specially on fullbacks/attacking wingers) that led on "breaking" the match after the 75-minute mark, giving too much spaces between and leading to more goals in that time gap.

What F4L REVISED gives is one of the most compact midfields and defenders closing up spaces, like real football. Player positioning was a key factor to see if the gameplay was improved. For example, Cole Palmer with Klashman tactics plays around an AMF with standard lineup and SS when out of possession. With F4L 4.4, you could see Palmer doing runs into the area making him an extra striker very near Nicolas Jackson, creating a big space in the front of the area. With F4L REVISED, Palmer doesn't do that and stays faithfully to the Klashman tactic explained before.

https://preview.redd.it/sywa7007e6ke1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4b3595acb4437ff69fd53e772b84c6955c7620c

Another case was seeing Amorim's United tactics in action. You know that Ruben uses his wingbacks to be very offensive, specially Dalot/Mazraoui, while keeping a 3 defender line at the back. To get it working properly, they must be "in sync" with the attacking wingers, because if Garnacho/Diallo are making runs to the sides and staying very far between them, it creates big empty spaces and literally no possession at all. With F4L REVISED, the behaviour from both parts have been very much improved, so you can see this. Notice how compact is Chelsea, and how close is the distance between players:

[Garnacho is going to recieve the ball and make a one-touch pass to Dalot. Dalot is making an offensive run.](https://preview.redd.it/272rm06te6ke1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e296455395b9fd735eb767728b42461ccf3a94e)

[Dalot recieves and creates a new offensive way with Garnacho running at his side. Notice how Chelsea is still closing up defending lines and not letting Hojlund make a run.](https://preview.redd.it/cgm8bfv0f6ke1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e60b42c02ae8837b35acd3e452c3e8c139f7b7c7)

  
Another big point is to keep the stats importance at the top. Everyone wants to see their fast players outrun slower defenders, but also not getting catched up out of nowhere. Let's see another example. Here, Palmer is battling Dalot while Madueke is making an overlapping run, fighting along Leny Yoro. Palmer is going to make a pass to Madueke when he is far enough:

https://preview.redd.it/8m9nmsq3g6ke1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc7311640896bbc239bc5881e5d88b9992d9127

[Madueke outruns Yoro and gets into the area, but De Ligt kept Nicolas Jackson space closed. Nicolas Jackson needs to make a different positional run to get a good pass from Madueke. Notice how CPU helps to defend and close more empty spaces, while the only three choices now are: pass the ball to Nicolas, keep runing or get the ball to Reece James at the side.](https://preview.redd.it/43nt4besf6ke1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af4d753326354bbc1caea5bc50b6c5a26d01f0f3)

To help with the stamina issue, a Stamina Mod will be included with a 10% boost included by default, as more percentage wasn't realistic at all, CPU wasn't making subs until min 85 and you could get wingers to avoid the red zone. A 10% helps to get those massive stamina drains happen like 4-5 minutes later in the game (around the 77-82 minute mark) instead of getting your players tired at 70 min.

This gameplay is designed on the line of the old F4L gameplays (version 3.X) when F4L only created them via Sider, as the gameplay editor decomps the dt18\_all.cpk file and making exports of that file also led to different gameplays, caused by some corruption of the gameplay editor. You know this game still hides a lot of stuff that we probably will never know, and you can see that a lot of gameplay makers have their own style of editing and they got even into deep hex editing to improve the game in some aspects. Still, the perfect gameplay will never exist so this is just a new experience aligned with the F4L vision of football, which most of you already liked a lot.

  
And yeah, MP3.1 will be released in the next 48 hours, probably more like Friday as I have to upload the whole thing twice (GoFile and Torrent) and finish some little details over there. You will see the thread as always here and pinned when it gets released. Remember: this is NOT an UPDATE to 3.0, but a new whole AIO with tons of fixes and 99% transfers until 18/02. See you there.

 Is this raw? I purchased this today for my cats and I compared it to the digestive care that I typically give them and I noticed this one says chicken by products and the other one does not say that. I looked up with chicken by products means and it looks like it is The bones and such… Does this mean this is raw? Wouldn’t it have to say if it was raw? Does anyone know if this line of royal canin is raw?

The market is in rough shape Solana has dropped, and people are saying memecoins are dead. But that’s exactly when real opportunities emerge.

Powsche isn’t just another memecoin. It’s a category-defining token with an actual story, a thriving community, and a strong narrative.

Memecoins that were built purely on hype are collapsing, but Powsche has always been different. This is a project with real culture, real milestones, and a real vision for the future.

When the market is down, smart money positions itself. The biggest gains always come from accumulating before the next wave. When people are scared, that’s when you should be paying attention.

Powsche has already survived multiple market dips and keeps proving its resilience. The roadmap is massive, the community is stronger than ever, and the brand keeps expanding.

If you think memecoins are done, you’re missing the bigger picture. Powsche always wins.

Hello All! Today I logged into my Mohela account and had a payment scheduled to be withdrawn on February 24th. I’m on the SAVE plan and have been stuck in this forbearance hold. I did recently submit paperwork to change plans as I sit at 116/120 payments. But that was legit last week and I’ve received zero communication on anything from Mohela. 

Has this happened to anyone else? I’m currently on hold with Mohela with a hold time estimated at 1 hour and 15 minutes. So thought why not ask here. Maybe faster!

2025-02-19 23:17:05 : Baby, 4 months male potential silent reflux : dee30242017 : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1itjr2v/baby_4_months_male_potential_silent_reflux/



I am reaching out for advice regarding my baby’s current health situation, as I am feeling quite confused and frustrated with the lack of clarity from our pediatrician. I want to ensure that I’m doing everything I can to provide the care my little one needs to feel comfortable and healthy.

Two weeks ago, my baby cried for about 20 minutes during a car ride, and the next day, her voice was almost completely gone. We followed the pediatrician’s advice and gave her as much vocal rest as possible, and although her voice has improved over the past two weeks, it still isn’t fully recovered. Our pediatrician has expressed concern that this may be related to silent reflux affecting her vocal cords, though this is something I’ve raised multiple times in the past, only to be told that she would “grow out of it.” 

The pediatrician has referred us to an ENT, but the appointment is not for another month. In the meantime, she has suggested a trial of PPIs for a week to see if it helps with her voice. I’m hesitant about this, particularly given the potential side effects and the fact that we’ve been managing ongoing issues with gas. I’m also unsure whether a week-long PPI trial would yield noticeable results if the issue is not silent reflux but rather vocal strain from crying. My main concern is that if the medication isn't necessary, we could be doing more harm than good.

Here are some symptoms and observations I’ve noticed that might provide more context:

- Since birth, my baby has been grunting and congested, though it has improved somewhat. She still has some congestion upon waking.
- She dislikes being in the car seat—I'm not sure whether it’s discomfort from pressure on her tummy or just a general dislike of being confined.
- She coughs a handful of times a day, though there are no signs of fever or illness.
- Previously, she had hiccups almost daily, but now it's down to about once a week.
- Her fussiness has increased, though it may be linked to possible teething or the four-month regression and being tired from awful sleep
- She cries at the breast and pops on and off; I’m unsure whether this is due to gas or just not being hungry. She is also feeding less frequently, going longer stretches between feeds (up to 3/3.5 hours vs. 2 hours). Due to her becoming distracted I feed her when drowsy upon waking up from a nap or dream feed if nap is short 
- She arches her back while crying when I feed her but it seems to be more from frustration than any sign of discomfort. Shed prefer sleeping than milk. 
- We do keep her upright for 10 minutes after feeding, and she plays comfortably on her back and doesn't fuss when on her back. Nighttime bassinet sleeping has been a recent issue but that might be more towards the regression

I’m struggling to understand whether these symptoms point more toward silent reflux or if they are simply a normal part of infant behavior. If it is silent reflux, wr didn't meducate or address it from day one since Dr said baby will grow out of it. Have we damaged her internal organs and throat due to this? 

Given all this, I’m wondering if it’s possible to wait for a month to see the ENT before starting the PPI trial, or if that delay could lead to irreversible damage to voice. Ultimately, I just want my baby’s voice to fully recover, but I’m unsure about the best way forward. 

Any guidance or advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.

2025-02-19 23:17:12 : Worst Songs of All Time Bracket : TKalig : https://www.reddit.com/r/MusicRecommendations/comments/1itjr5y/worst_songs_of_all_time_bracket/

Salutations all! I’m looking to do a bracket based competition on the worst songs of all time. I run a small niche community and I’m trying to expand out into other topics. A big focus of the community is art appreciation. Part of what I’m trying to do is get into music reviews with community feedback. So my first review for the channel is the idea of finding the worst songs ever and ranking them. This idea is highly inspired by the YouTube channels Hivemind and BradTasteinMusic. What I’m looking for is the worst of the worst music. Can be as popular or niche as you’d like. More important than the song itself is your justification for why you think it is your worst song ever heard. I want to hear your reasoning for your decision. If two people submit the same song, the reasoning will decide who gets to claim it as their entry. Depending on turnout, I will then enter the top picked songs into a bracket competition. The top four picks will get their selector prizes. Reddit and many subs are particular about giving details on that, so I will be releasing a video giving specifics should turnout be worth it. I hope to hear some of the worst music out there and look forward to your argument as to why! It’s my intent to do this stream as soon as possible assuming turnout isn’t terrible.

Hi everyone,

I'm from Plug In America - a national nonprofit organization with a mission to accelerate the transition to affordable and accessible plug-in vehicles and charging through education, advocacy, and research.

We recently launched our [**2025 EV Driver Annual Survey**](https://pluginamerica.org/survey/2025-ev-driver-survey/), and we would like to invite you to take it! Industry leaders and policymakers use this survey to guide their thinking, and our organization uses it to form policy recommendations and consumer messaging. It should take you no more than 15 minutes to fill out, and **we ask that only those of you in the United States** **do so**.

[Last year](https://pluginamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Plug-In-America-EPRI-EV-Driver-Survey-Report_Final.pdf), the EV6 was one of the more popular vehicles among respondents in our survey. Furthermore, it received the second-highest rating of an EV for satisfaction in charging speed. We want to capture even more EV6 drivers this year. Even if you drive a different EV or don't drive an EV at all, we'd still like to hear from you! 

Thank you to anyone who fills it out and to the mods for allowing us to post the survey here.

## Why You Need a 16TB External Hard Drive in 2025

before diving into specific models and features, let's address the essential question: why should you consider a 16TB external hard drive? The answer lies in the increasing size and complexity of the digital world.

*   **For Creative Professionals:** Photographers, videographers, graphic designers, and other visual artists are constantly dealing with massive files. High-resolution photos, 4K and 8K video footage, and complex design projects demand significant storage capacity.

## Key Considerations When Choosing a 16TB External Hard Drive

Selecting the right 16TB external hard drive requires careful consideration of several factors. Here's what to keep in mind:

*   **Storage Capacity (Usable):** While you're buying a "16TB" drive, the actual usable capacity will always be slightly less due to formatting and operating system overhead. Expect around 14.5-15TB of usable space. This is normal for all hard drives.*   **Drive Type (HDD vs. SSD):** The vast majority of 16TB external hard drives utilize conventional Hard Disk Drive (HDD) technology. Solid State Drives (SSDs) offer significantly faster performance but are currently much more expensive at this capacity. While 16TB SSD external drives exist, their cost is prohibitive for most users. Thus, this guide focuses primarily on HDD-based 16tb external hard drive.

*   **Interface (USB 3.0 vs. USB-C):** The interface determines the speed at which data can be transferred between the drive and your computer. USB 3.0 is a common standard and offers fast transfer speeds. USB-C is a newer standard that provides even faster transfer speeds and can also be used for power delivery. The best 16tb external hard drive will support either USB 3.0 or USB-C. Look for a 16 tb external hard drive usb c if your computer has a USB-C port, otherwise USB 3.0 is sufficient.

*   **Transfer Speed (RPM and Interface Speed):** For HDDs, the Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) indicates the rotational speed of the platters inside the drive. Higher RPMs generally result in faster transfer speeds. The interface speed (e.g.,5Gbps for USB 3.0, 10Gbps or 20Gbps for USB-C) represents the maximum theoretical data transfer rate. Real-world speeds will be lower, but a faster interface allows the drive to perform at its best.

*   **Reliability and Warranty:** Data loss can be devastating. choose a reputable brand known for producing reliable hard drives. Check the warranty period offered by the manufacturer. A longer warranty indicates greater confidence in the product's durability. Look for a reliable 16tb external hard drive from brands like Western Digital or Seagate.

*   **Power Source:** Most 16TB external hard drives are desktop models and require an external power adapter.Portable 16TB external hard drives are rare and might potentially be more expensive, but they draw power directly from the USB port.*   **Software and Features:** Some manufacturers include backup software, security features, or drive management utilities. Consider whether these features are significant to you. some drives, like those from seagate, offer Rescue Data Recovery Services.

*   **Compatibility:** Ensure the 16tb hard drive compatible with Mac or Windows, depending on your operating system. Most drives are compatible with both, but you may need to reformat the drive for optimal performance on macOS.

*   **Price:** The 16tb external hard drive price can vary significantly depending on the brand, features, and retailer. Compare prices from different sources to find the best deal. Keep an eye out for 16tb external hard drive deals, especially during sales events like Black Friday. The 16tb external hard drive black friday sales are a great time to purchase.

*   **Form Factor (3.5" vs 2.5"):** The external hard drive 16tb 3.5" drives are the most common. The 2.5" drives are usually reserved for smaller capacity drives.

## Optimizing Your 16TB External Hard Drive for Performance

Once you've chosen your 16TB external hard drive, there are several steps you can take to optimize its performance:

*   **Use the Correct Interface:** Ensure you're connecting the drive to a USB 3.0 or USB-C port on your computer to achieve the fastest possible transfer speeds. avoid using USB 2.0 ports, as they will significantly limit performance.

*   **Defragment Your drive (Windows):** Over time, files can become fragmented on hdds, slowing down access times. Use the Disk Defragmenter tool in Windows to defragment your drive regularly. This is less important for SSDs.

*   **Format Your Drive Appropriately:** If you're using the drive primarily with macOS, format it using the APFS (Apple File System) for optimal performance. If you're using it with Windows, NTFS is the standard file system.exFAT is a good option for cross-platform compatibility.

*   **Disable Indexing (If Necesary):** Windows and macOS automatically index files on your drives, which can consume system resources. If you're experiencing performance issues, you can disable indexing for your external hard drive. However, this will make searching for files slower.

*   **Keep Your Drive Cool:** Overheating can negatively impact the performance and lifespan of your hard drive. Ensure the drive has adequate ventilation and is not exposed to direct sunlight or excessive heat.

*   **Maintain Free Space:** Ideally, you should keep at least 15-20% of your drive's capacity free to ensure optimal performance.A full drive can become slow and inefficient.

*   **Use a High-Quality USB Cable:** The USB cable connecting the drive to your computer can effect transfer speeds. Use the cable that came with the drive or purchase a high-quality USB cable to ensure a stable and fast connection.

## Using a 16TB External Drive for Specific Applications

Different applications require different levels of performance and reliability from your 16TB external hard drive. Here's how to optimize your drive for specific use cases:

*   **For Video Editing:** Video editing requires fast transfer speeds and reliable performance. Choose a drive with a high RPM (7200 RPM is ideal) and a USB 3.0 or USB-C interface. Consider a drive designed for professional use, such as the LaCie d2 Professional. The 16tb external drive for video editing should prioritize speed and reliability.

*   **For Plex Media Server:** When using a 16TB external hard drive for Plex, prioritize reliability and capacity. Transfer speeds are less critical, as plex primarily streams content over your local network. A Western Digital Elements or Seagate Expansion drive is a good choice. The 16tb external drive for plex should be reliable and offer sufficient storage.

*   **For Backups:** For backups, reliability is paramount. Choose a reputable brand with a good warranty. Consider using backup software that supports incremental backups, which only copies new or changed files to save time and storage space. The external hard drive 16tb backup is a common use case.

*   **For Gaming:** While an SSD is generally preferred for game installations due to its faster loading times, a 16TB HDD can be used to store less frequently played games or game recordings. To minimize loading times, consider a drive with a high RPM and a USB 3.0 or USB-C connection depending on if your gaming PC has the correct USB connection.[[Explore Top Rated 16tb external hard drive on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-hard-drive/?kw=16tb external hard drive)

2025-02-19 23:17:17 : Advice on Columbia MPH : Accomplished_Hat8299 : https://www.reddit.com/r/mphadmissions/comments/1itjr8l/advice_on_columbia_mph/

Hi everyone! I need some advice so I got into Columbia's MPH program for a full-time two year in Epi. I'm currently in undergrad at UConn and have already started my MPH there through an accelerated program. I've taken 12 credits at UConn towards my MPH so I would be able to finish up my degree with one additional year after undergrad instead of 2.  I decided to apply out because I'm really interested in topics of public health and UConn doesn't have concentrations or resources to support those interests. Columbia's Epi program and the certificates they have are EXACTLY what I want to pursue which is pushing me towards that, but I am also planning on going to med school after and I'm debating if its worth the extra time and money to get the degree from Columbia. I am from NY and it would be nice to live out my early 20s in the city but I just want to know if people think this is worth the switch.

What are some offbeat or specific qualities you find attractive in people?

I find myself *extremely* attracted to teachers or men who work in education in some capacity. It shows that they are intelligent, great with kids, have good interpersonal skills, are funny, etc. It signals to me that they would be a great father. As someone who values education and is interested in homeschooling, I think we would be a great match. It just really turns me on, haha.

Second up would be pilots. I don't know why, but I've always had a thing for guys who like airplanes, go into the air force, etc. They tend to be nerdy, have great technical skills, a sense of adventure, remain calm under pressure, etc. Plus, going on a flight sounds like a super cool and romantic date idea. I think a pilot would be a really fun and adventurous husband. :)

Hi Folks,

  
I'm doing another run and just used the puzzle skips for the water treatment facility. I noticed however that after doing so I cannot seem to find the GUM room key or Beryl Grid key. Have any of you experienced the puzzle skips removing key items from the game?

  
I checked the door for the Fenniken encounter and it is still locked. Kind of rough since this is my catch em all run. I don't mind debugging Fenniken but if this messes with post game quests I'll be bummed.

It writhes, twists and claws at its surroundings. The skin. A jumble of contorted bits of tissue cells. It was hollow. Lifeless and full of life at the same time. It wanted a host. Something to cling to. Someone to assist it in its endeavours. 

It scurried along the hospital's floor. Almost running. It saw a nurse. It attacked, suffocating her to death. She wouldn't do. She had her skin. It had spent a year searching for a skinless host. It had killed 4 people on its journey. She was the 5th.

It kept slithering along the white floors. Then it finally came across a treasure trove of possible hosts. The morgue.

After killing its 6th victim, it found what it wanted. A burnt, skinless host. It latched on, feeling happy. However more importantly, it finally felt. It left the hospital, it felt good.

2025-02-19 23:26:16 : First Time Condo Anxieties : Middle-Unable : https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1itjykp/first_time_condo_anxieties/

So as the title sort of implies, I just bought my first condo. And I'm incredibly anxious about it.

I'm a 28 year old female who has been living at home since I graduated University in order to save money. This allowed me to save greatly, thanks to my job and parents.

It's a one bedroom, one bathroom condo in Richmond Hill. Top floor, guess you could call it a penthouse but it's only 615sqft so not much to brag about. The building is slightly older, 12 years to be exact. In great shape and the condo management has fantastic reviews. Two lawyers agreed the status certificate looked great and had no concerns. Maintenance fees have been steady and have only raised 35 dollars in 7 years with no expected raises for the next 2 years and no special assessments anytime soon.

Condo is cute. I love it. Floor to ceiling windows the entire one wall. Small, but I am only one girl and a cat so who cares.

But I care... and now, a week after my offer went firm, I'm filled with dread. I can afford it. Finances aren't really my concern. I got the condo for $25,000 under asking... but I still panic that I over paid and I'll never make that money back. For what it's worth, I paid low $500,000's for the condo.

I guess what I'm lamenting at here is... is this normal? To feel this way? I was excited for all of an hour before my stomach turned on me with dread. Now I can't stop obsessively watching the market and seeing what other condo are selling for. 

Any thoughts please. To calm a first time buyer

Hello. I’m so frustrated with my work environment. This is my 4th year and my admin still do not understand my role. I have lunch duty 30 mins daily, I have 10 mins of arrival duty and 10 mins of dismissal duty. For the whole month of March my co counselor and I have to host students that are fasting for Ramadan and that’s an additional 30-40 mins each day. When we try to advocate that it takes us away from our services, they blame it on a lack of staffing. I feel like so much falls on us. Even when there are assemblies- students that can’t go because of discipline reasons or if it becomes too loud or something, there students come to us. We have no boundaries and just can’t say no. It’s absolutely ridiculous.

2025-02-19 23:26:36 : Am I the jerk for not wanting to pay back my sister? : HappyCat125 : https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1itjytr/am_i_the_jerk_for_not_wanting_to_pay_back_my/


Context: Everyone in my family knows that I'm not very good at saving money. Recently, my sister lost my beloved pet cat, and I am extremely mad and upset about it.

I owe my sister $30, but she also owes me a lot more money. However, I don't keep track of it because money doesn't really matter to me.
I have an Xbox GamePass subscription(which i DONT EVEN USE, only she does), but because my cat is missing, I haven't been able to renew it. My sister got upset when I told her about the GamePass and started saying that she always does everything for me. I told her that's not true because I have given her a lot of things in the past, including food and drinks from my job at Dunkin Donuts.
I am very frustrated because I am the only one looking for our lost cat, while everyone else has given up hope. I feel like I am being blamed for everything, even though I am the one putting in the most effort to find the cat.
Because of all this, I told my sister that I wont be paying her back until she helps me look for the cat. I also pointed out that I pay for a lot more things in the house, including the WiFi, while she only pays for Netflix. She said she’s given up and is okay that we wont find him, its only been about 2, just TWO weeks and she’s already given up.
I know I'm not perfect and may have done some things wrong, but I believe that my sister is also at fault in this situation.

2025-02-19 23:26:35 : Is it too late? : Sky260309 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1itjytm/is_it_too_late/

I had joined the conversion program back in October (roughly), the one where new found Catholics come together to learn about the faith before being baptised (and in my case, confirmed and given the Eucharist) on Easter Sunday. I only attended two of these weekly meetings back in October/November time before I wasn’t able to go back due to a busy schedule, stress etc.

I know it’s no excuse and any able-bodied person should go to church but I have high levels of anxiety and I was taken by surprise when the person who said they would accompany me to these meetings as moral support backed out because they felt that they were being included too much in the process (e.g saying prayers off of a leaflet in a circle and sharing experiences) along with the fact that they aren’t “the one who wants to be Catholic”. 

So I stopped going, I admit. It was a thing where I kept saying the following week and it never happened, because I was just foolishly wanting on this person to come with me even though they didn’t want to and there were weeks when this person was out of town and they were my means of getting to Church so I physically couldn’t but, all in all, I haven’t gone back in about 3 months. I know Catholics are forgiving and open but I can’t help but feel embarrassed for committing to this thing, that I do truly want and have prayed on, and then not being bothered to go. 

At this rate, there is less time leading up to Easter than there is since I last went to the Church but I was wondering if I should still go back and any advice on how to soften the blow of returning (for when I see the priest and another sister who sits in on the meetings). It really is a small, intimate group, there has never been more than one other attendee whilst I’ve gone (twice) so as far as I know three people in total wanting to be baptised, both much older than me however, this group may have expanded between now and then. 

I really just need some advice on how to approach the situation, the next meeting is tomorrow, I do really want to attend but is it too late? Should I wait to the next cycle?

2025-02-22 18:34:20 : Your Higher Self knows your future and all its possible combinations, and it will communicate with you through goosebumps and more. : Vib_ration : https://www.reddit.com/r/neoshamanism/comments/1ivpl28/your_higher_self_knows_your_future_and_all_its/

Whatever choice you make your Higher-self knows the series of events after that, And if you wish to get to a certain point in your life in the future, it knows how to get there exactly, step by step.

Could it be possible to have a direct line of communication with your Higher-Self? Yes.

First you need to understand that the reason why you experience non-instantaneous gratification of your wishes is that you may not be listening to your Higher-Self. That delay is caused by differences between what your ego, your personality, here on earth-chooses and what your Higher self will let you know to do or not to do.

A really efficient way to open up to it's guidance is by becoming aware of the goosebumps/chills that you get from a positive external or internal situations/stimuli like listening to a song you really like, thinking about a lover, watching a moving movie scene, striving, feeling thankful, praising God, praying, etc.

Feeling them from a positive stimuli is what distinguishes normal everyday goosebumps to the spiritual chills you experience as a confirmation from your higher-self. This is one way it communicates with you.

If you take time to notice you will find that those positive chills have are accompanied by a subtle energy underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot). Eventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps, everywhere you want and for the duration you desire.

After researching what that specific current underneath the skin is I came across a LOT of information on it from all around the world.

This energy has been researched and documented under many names, by different people and cultures, such as the [Runner's High](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/s/hYzxvrJBWo), what's felt during an [ASMR](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/19eo2gr/introduction_to_asmr/) session, [Bioelectricity](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zflei/introduction_to_bioelectric/), [Euphoria](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfn2t/introduction_to_euphoria/), [Ecstasy](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfnph/introduction_to_ecstasy/), [Voluntary Piloerection (goosebumps)](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfog0/introduction_to_voluntary_piloerection/), [Frisson](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zflxi/introduction_to_frisson/), the [Vibrational State](https://www.reaprendentia.org/vibrational-state-effects-and-recommendations/#:~:text=The%20vibrational%20state%20indicates%20a,can%20also%20promote%20physical%20health) before an Astral Projection, [Spiritual Energy](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfi0a/introduction_to_spiritual_energy/), [Orgone](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfrvc/introduction_to_orgone/), [Rapture](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/1alb9ur/introduction_to_rapture/), [Tension](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfth4/introduction_to_tension/), [Aura](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfssu/introduction_to_aura/), [Nen](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfs7u/introduction_to_nen/), [Odic force](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfr4a/introduction_to_odic_force/), Secret Fire, [Tummo](https://www.reddit.com/r/tummo/comments/18su94t/introduction_to_tummo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), as [Qi](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfp1u/introduction_to_qi/) in Taoism / Martial Arts, as [Prana](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfkmj/introduction_to_prana/) in Hindu philosophy, [Ihi ](https://www.google.com/imgres?q=ihi%20maori&amp;imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Flookaside.fbsbx.com%2Flookaside%2Fcrawler%2Fmedia%2F%3Fmedia_id%3D5788230414520966%26get_thumbnail%3D1&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpikitehauora%2Fvideos%2Fihi-the-definition-as-it-is-written-in-te-aka-the-m%25C4%2581ori-dictionary-pronunciation%2F5788230414520966%2F&amp;docid=5VA1uPZ7vV6azM&amp;tbnid=TyqeYMx0vEageM&amp;vet=12ahUKEwi8-MDu_c2LAxUmHjQIHZdZAbQQM3oECFoQAA..i&amp;w=720&amp;h=720&amp;hcb=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8-MDu_c2LAxUmHjQIHZdZAbQQM3oECFoQAA)and [Mana](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfsi7/introduction_to_mana/) in the oceanic cultures, [Life force](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18xusu4/introduction_to_life_force/), [Vayus](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfpep/introduction_to_vayus/), [Intent](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfqno/introduction_to_intent/), [Pitī](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfpsw/introduction_to_pit%C4%AB/), [Aether](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfu3w/introduction_to_aether/), [Spiritual Chills](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/), [Chills](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/) from positive events/stimuli, [The Tingles](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zflxi/introduction_to_frisson/), [on-demand quickening](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfog0/introduction_to_voluntary_piloerection/), [Ruah](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoColdSZA/comments/18zfuig/introduction_to_r%C3%BBah/) and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.

All of those terms detail that this subtle energy activation has been discovered to provide various **biological benefits**, such as:

* Unblocking your lymphatic system/meridians
* Feeling euphoric/ecstatic throughout your whole body
* Guiding your "[Spiritual Chills](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/)"  anywhere in your body
* Controlling your temperature
* Giving yourself goosebumps
* Dilating your pupils
* Regulating your heartbeat
* Counteracting stress/anxiety in your body
* Internally healing yourself
* Accessing your hypothalamus on demand
* Control your Tensor Tympani muscle

and I discovered other usages for it which are more "**spiritual**" like:

* A confirmation sign
* Accurately using your psychic senses (clairvoyance, clairaudience, spirit projection, higher-self guidance, third-eye vision)
* Managing your auric field
* Manifestation
* Energy absorption from any source
* Seeing through your eyelids.

Here are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) going more in-depth about this subtle "energy", explicitly revealing how you can learn to feel it voluntarily, feel it anywhere/everywhere, amplify it and those biological/spiritual usages.

P.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/Spiritualchills  where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.

2025-02-23 11:54:13 : 31st august 2024: Jewish Columbia students were chased out of dorms, spat on, and pinned against walls: damning report : LedofZeppelin : https://www.reddit.com/r/BeneiYisraelNews/comments/1iw8icb/31st_august_2024_jewish_columbia_students_were/

Jewish students at Columbia University were chased out of their dorms, received death threats, spat upon, stalked and pinned against walls, as the Ivy League school devolved into a cesspool of antisemitic hate in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 murderous raid on Israel.

The new and disturbing details emerged from the [lengthy, 91-page document](https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Announcements/Report-2-Task-Force-on-Antisemitism.pdf) released Friday by the school’s faculty-led antisemitism task force, which revealed the extent to which the hate permeated the institution.

“Students described being shoved, pushed to the ground, berated for showing support for Zionist causes, and watching [Israeli flags burned](https://nypost.com/2024/04/22/us-news/jewish-columbia-student-says-protesters-burned-his-israeli-flag-hit-him-in-face-with-rocks/),” the task force’s authors wrote.

https://preview.redd.it/dgjrhvasnvke1.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eb2d53629ec8718744f368783fa40a47849b389

“They recounted seeing drawings of swastikas in their dorms, students yelling pro-Hamas chants, and being denied access to public spaces and opportunities simply because they were Jewish or Israeli.”

Testimony from nearly five hundred Columbia students informed the report, which found visibly observant Jews had been pinned to the wall and had their jewelry ripped off while coming and going from synagogue. Others recounted being spat on and having been called ethnic slurs on campus.

One student, who had installed a mezuzah on her dorm’s doorway prior to the Israel-Hamas war, was forced to move out after people were pounding her door throughout the night beginning in October, demanding she explain the Jewish state’s war in Gaza. 

“If I walk on campus right now with my star out or kippah or say ‘am Yisrael chai,’ I could start World War III,” one anonymous student’s testimony read.

Instructors tasked with guiding and mentoring students instead contributed to the sense of isolation and unease among Jews and Israelis on campus, according to the report. 

https://preview.redd.it/441ls4lvnvke1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11ac0ba9c761223505fd55822ffb1f94964fb3a6

One faculty member leading a class that delved into the Israel-Hamas conflict called a student who previously served in the IDF a murderer. Another professor extensively said a pair of Jewish donors to the university had “laundered” “dirty money” and “blood money.” 

During the spring, as protests and encampments roiled the school’s Morningside Heights campus, protesters, including outsiders and members of the university community, bellowed death threats at Jewish students. Demonstrators who held Israeli flags, meanwhile, recalled being assaulted. 

“There is a sense of personal threat, and we keep looking over our shoulders,” master’s student Omer Lubaton Granot, an Israeli veteran and father of a toddler, told an Israeli radio station in the wake of protesters seizing the [academic building Hamilton Hall](https://nypost.com/2024/04/30/us-news/columbia-university-protesters-take-over-hamilton-hall/) in April.

https://preview.redd.it/zqkgo09xnvke1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb17d824b6428a57c8f4b28917a22793be63a2b4

Councilman Eric Dinowitz (D-Bronx) described the students’ testimonies as “horrifying — and not surprising.” 

“These are stories we’ve been hearing about, as the report says, even before the encampments,” he told The Post, adding that antisemitism had been on the rise at college campuses even before Oct. 7

“Without any sort of consequence \[for students and faculty\] this sort of behavior will continue.”

https://preview.redd.it/to3l191znvke1.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74ef6943ccb56ce54e2547c51372c3dabd237324

The task force offered several recommendations to address the issues detailed in the voluminous report, including improved anti-bias training for students and staff along with a new system for reporting complaints about antisemitism. 

The report was issued just days before Columbia’s fall semester begins and less then three weeks after embattled university president Minouhce Shafik suddenly resigned, citing the “period of turmoil” that marred her brief tenure at the school. 

Interim President Katrina Armstrong [called](https://president.columbia.edu/news/statement-interim-president-armstrong-second-report-task-force-antisemitism) the disturbing incidents “completely unacceptable” before rattling off new initiatives at the university aligning with the panel’s recommendations.  

“This is an opportunity to acknowledge the harm that has been done and to pledge to make the changes necessary to do better and to rededicate ourselves, as university leaders, as individuals, and as a community, to our core mission of teaching and research,” she said.

2025-02-23 11:54:09 : Regarding the custom cards... : Truly_Organic : https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1iw8ibb/regarding_the_custom_cards/

Seeing as currently there's a community vote going on (which I would recommend checking out in community highlights!) I want to propose another solution.

How about making another flair meant for them specifically, called "Custom Card" or something like that? That or simply allocating them to Art(OC) flair.

Card concepts posted outside of that flair would simply be removed and OP would be requested to post them under the proper flair.

I know that's pretty much the same as the current plan but with a flair instead of the Content Creator Hub, but simply I don't think said Content Creator Hub is fit for posting custom cards there, since it's basically a single big megathread and it would become painfully long to scroll through with all the artwork and discussion regarding it under every single one of them. It would be better if it stayed as a place for sharing video content only.

Sorry for the long message. I hope it's ok of I express my Idea in a post like this...

2025-02-23 11:54:21 : Top VPNs for Georgia : Dear-Owl7333 : https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1iw8iez/top_vpns_for_georgia/

Georgia, a nation where the Caucasus Mountains meet the Black Sea, offers a captivating blend of history, culture, and natural beauty. But in our interconnected times, there's another aspect to consider: digital freedom and security. Whether you're a local resident, a digital nomad soaking in the vibes of Tbilisi, or simply planning a visit, understanding the need for a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is paramount.

Why? Because in Georgia, as in many places, the internet isn't always as open and secure as we might hope. You may encounter geo restrictions that block access to some streaming content, government monitoring that threatens privacy, and cyber threats that put your personal information at risk.

But don't worry! A dependable VPN can be your passport to online liberty and protection. This blog post cuts through the technical jargon and offers a simple rundown of the top VPNs for Georgia in 2025, focusing on what matters: security, speed, and access.

# Why Use a VPN in Georgia?

Think of a VPN as a digital bodyguard. It creates a secure, encrypted "tunnel" for your internet traffic, concealing your data from prying eyes and making it look like you're connecting from somewhere else. Here's why it's beneficial:

* **Circumventing Geo Restrictions:** Ever tried to watch your favorite show only to be met with the frustrating message "This content is not available in your region"? VPNs let you bypass these blocks, accessing streaming services like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and even local Georgian channels from anywhere.
* **Protecting Your Privacy:** In a world of increasing surveillance, a VPN encrypts your online activity, making it harder for governments, ISPs, or cybercriminals to track your browsing history, communications, and location.
* **Securing Public Wi-Fi:** Public Wi-Fi hotspots are notorious for being insecure, leaving your data vulnerable to hackers. A VPN shields your information on these networks, keeping your passwords, financial details, and personal data safe.
* **Unfettered Access to Info:** While Georgia enjoys relatively high internet freedom, some restrictions and monitoring exist. A VPN helps ensure you can access a wide spectrum of info without fear of censorship.

# What Makes a Great VPN for Georgia?

Not all VPNs are created equal. To ensure the best protection and access, here are some essential characteristics to seek:

* **A Substantial Server Network:** Look for a VPN with servers in many countries, including Georgia or nearby regions. This gives you speed, reliability, and the ability to connect to local content.
* **Blazing Fast Speeds:** No one wants to contend with buffering and lag. Prioritize VPNs known for their high-speed servers, so you can stream, game, and browse without hiccups.
* **Military-Grade Security:** Your VPN should employ powerful encryption protocols (like AES 256-bit) to keep your data safe from hackers and surveillance. Extras like a kill switch and DNS leak protection are very appreciated.
* **A Strict No-Logs Policy:** This means the VPN provider doesn't track or store your online activity, offering assurance that your privacy is respected.
* **Easy-to-Use Apps:** The VPN apps should be simple to set up and use on all devices, whether you're a tech whiz or a novice user.
* **Reliable Customer Support:** Access to prompt and knowledgeable customer support is invaluable, particularly if you encounter any issues.
* **A Trustworthy Money-Back Guarantee:** This allows you to test the service risk-free and get refunded if it doesn't meet your needs.

PIA is recognized for its high-end security features.

* **Why It's Great:** Advanced security features, including WireGuard protocol and a kill switch to avoid privacy breaches. The default AES 128-bit encryption has fast speeds. It also offers a built in blocker to maintain user privacy.
* **Downsides:** Some forums and support documentation might be a little outdated.
* **What It's Ideal For:** People who need many servers, strong encryption against cyber threats, and the ability to use the VPN on numerous devices.

* **Downsides:** Some of the advanced features might take a little while to master.

* **What It's Ideal For:** This VPN is the best value for Georgia, with unlimited simultaneous devices.

# Other Solid VPN Choices

These VPNs might not be top contenders but provide reasonable service

* **IPVanish:** It's good for VPN newcomers but it's Georgia servers are lacking.
* **PrivateVPN:** PrivateVPN is known for P2P features and is an option for torrenting.
* **ProtonVPN:** Offers excellent performance and reliability but the user will sacrifice security.

# Using a VPN in Georgia: Quick Setup Guide

Getting started with a VPN in Georgia is simple:

1. **Choose a VPN:** Select a VPN provider from the above list, taking into account your requirements and budget.
2. **Download the App:** Get the VPN app for your device (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, etc.) from the provider's website.
3. **Install and Launch:** Install the app and open it.
4. **Connect to a Server:** Choose a server location. If you wish to access local Georgian content, pick a server in Georgia. If you're streaming content from another area, choose a server in that region.
5. **Surf Securely:** Once connected, your internet traffic is secured. You can now browse, stream, and perform tasks knowing your information is safe.

# Common Questions Answered

* **Is it legal to use a VPN in Georgia?** Yes, it is perfectly legal. There aren't any specific rules prohibiting VPN use in Georgia.
* **Can a VPN truly protect me from everything?** While VPNs offer enhanced security and privacy, they're not impenetrable shields. It's still crucial to practice good habits online, such as using strong passwords, being mindful of phishing attempts, and avoiding dubious sites.
* **Will a VPN slow down my internet speed?** All VPNs have the potential to reduce your connection speed somewhat because of the encryption process. Nevertheless, top-tier VPNs maintain super-fast servers that reduce the effects on your speed.
* **Can I use a free VPN?** While tempting, free VPNs typically come with serious limits regarding speed, bandwidth, and security. Some may even track and sell your information, undermining the function of using a VPN to start with. It's generally best to stay with a paid service with a solid history.
* **How do I know if my VPN is working?** You can utilize a variety of web tools to determine if your IP address has been masked and if your DNS is secure. Look for "IP leak tests" online.

Here is my 100% truth answer to the email, I'm sure this is what he is looking for

1. I attend unproductive meetings where there is a lack of clear direction and no support offered to assist the field IT staff

2. I support aging hardware and have to respond to "why is the network slow" even after I have told them that they need to replace the CAT3 cabling for the last 15 years

3. I continue to resolve the same tickets for the same users who still do not know how to select the right printer

4. I have to drop everything and reimage end user laptops that they swear they use but they don't, and they drop off AD over and over again

5. I have to teach myself how to support software products my Agency creates and does not provide me any training

6. I do the job of other departments because they are clueless as to how to get work done and if I wait for them to do it, it could delay me endlessly

As someone with three kids, I am always looking for ways to have fun with my kids here in Madrid. There are plenty of museums and parks to go to, but every so often we come across an original attraction, and the museum of Illusions in Madrid is a great way to spend some fun time with your kids. If you are looking for some fun things to do in Madrid, be sure to add this place to your list.

The staff are really nice here, super friendly to the kids and adults alike and this really adds to the experience. It can get pretty busy and there can be queues at times, so its really a good idea to pre book your tickets for the museum of illusions before hand to avoid long queues.

The Museum of Illusions is conveniently located right in the heart of Madrid city center and you can walk there in a couple of minutes from the Puerta del Sol. So once you finish up here, you can just continue your tour through the city without having to travel any great distance.

Hey everyone,

I’m working on a Next.js project that currently handles authentication using Lucia Auth. Everything is working perfectly, and I’d prefer not to change any code if I don’t have to.

However, I recently saw on the Lucia Auth GitHub page that it’s going to be deprecated soon.

My question is:
Is it okay to leave the code as it is and continue using Lucia Auth?

Would appreciate any insights or advice. Thanks in advance!

2025-02-23 11:55:11 : Catalans, així no anem a cap lloc. : WildTwist8515 : https://www.reddit.com/r/catalunya/comments/1iw8iuq/catalans_així_no_anem_a_cap_lloc/

He comentat una publicació anterior i a rel del que dit i llegint una mica més, crec oportú fer la aportació del que són les meves obsevacions. Aquesta publicació inclou el que he dit anteriorment a l'altre publicació i més.
Tinc 29, sóc Catalana del Maresme (BCN) per part de mare i "xernega" per part de pare. Amb cadascún parlo el corresponent. (Sense contacte actual amb el pare, així doncs, a casa meva sol es parla el Català)
Aclarar que, dono la raó aquells que diuen que hi ha gent que no te cap mena d'interès en integrar-se, adaptar-se... La meva família Andalusa no ha après el Català...horrible sii...
Al que vaig,.. parlo més llengües, una vegada passes a ser poliglota i, si viatges una mica, et dons conte de que la comunicació entre persones es molt important, un no s'expressa de la mateixa manera parlant una llegua o un altre (Això es molt interessant, es canvia de personalitat fins hi tot). Hi ha vegades que una llegua pot expressar/dir molt més que un altre i un mateix a de fer per que el receptor del teu missatge l'entengui.
I el més important de tot el que volia dir. HEU DE PORTAR EL CATALÀ FORA!!! Jo sempre sempre sempre que parlo amb gent no catalaparlants, fora de la nostre estimada Catalunya, els hi vaig introduint paraules en Català, dites curtes, petites expressions catalanes, etc. Com ara bé, Bon día! A reveure! Un petó, la paraula -grillat- agrada molt, -cullons- també agrada (com no..), -campi qui pugui-, -senyoret/a-, si em diuen -Tengo hambree!!, jo responc - Tens gana? Doncs menjat una cama!. I molt més.
Evidentment tradueixo sempre, el que vull es que m'entenguin, la gent es molt agraïda arreu del món, gairebé tothom s'interessa una miqueta més per el Català i a molt poca gent els molesta, crec que s'ha generalitzat massa o potser es la percepció que sentim el catalans aqui Catalunya, el que ens fan creure.... Evidentment, a la actualitat hi han menys catalaparlants però es cosa nostre i no tant de la opressió, deixem el passat, no hi ha excusa. Porteu el Català més enllà de les fronteres catalanes, els idiomes són riquesa, la gent inteligent amb cultura propia i afam per tindre coneixements ho agrairà i el que no, pe'l que em fá a mi, que l'hi donguin pe'l cul, no mereixen el nostre esforç en fer-se'ls entre res.
Deixeu el que, qui o quan, simplement parleu Català a Catalunya i arreu del món, ajudeu al qui no l'enten parlant-li Català i traduint si fa falta!  
Per què hi han tantes proclamacions demanant que hi s'hi apliqui més el Català a les aules, les app, cartells informatius, cartes/menú de bars/restaurants, etc? Desde quan les esferes polítiques han produït canvis d'aquesta mena sense la insistència del poble?
De veritat creieu que aquesta es la manera correcta de demanar el canvi? Fent crits a l'aire?
Perquè els nen no parlem a l'hora del esbarjo el Català? O sol el parlen entre els que a casa seva el parlen però en canvi si es dirigeixen a un altre alumne canvien de llengua?
No es tindrà que comença a les portes del colegi? Papis i mamis que recolliu els vostres nens, en contes de estar demanat als colegis que ho facin tot? La educació i perpetuació dels valors de la llengua i la cultura no correspon als pares? Si un nen castellaparlant escolta per un segon que algú es dirigeix cap els seus pares en Català, no creieu que, mica en mica, el nen associarà que si entre els seus pares i els d'un altre nen s'intenten comunicar lleugerament en Català, alomillor ell també ho pot fer amb el fill d'aquells pares que l'hi parlen Català al seus? Grups de WhatsApp...papis i mamis..el mateix dic. Això pe'l que fá a les escoles, que es un comença! 
Recordeu que si algú al que l'hi parles en Català, canvia al Castellà, es la manera que te de comunicar-se, parleu Català i traduir-lo si fá falta.
El mateix amb un restaurant, de cop i volta es torna turístic i es possa una carta en Anglès, adaptació de mercat.
Desde quan la oferta va abans que la demanda? Així no funciona. Primer hi ha demanda, que la gent de peu ho parli, es faci entendre pe'l demés i la societat s'adapta, possarà el Català arreu.
EXPLICARÉ AIXÒ, que veig a un munt de gent dient, -peroooooò si ja demaneeeeen!!!!-
[Entenem per oferta/demanda de mercat! La demanda NO es demanar/proclamar, ES LA NECESSITAT! (Molts catalaparlants crea la NECESSITAT de tindre el Català per tot arreu). La oferta es la resposta aquesta necessitat, és a dir, app en Català, dibuixos infantils, informació en carreteras, infinites possibilitats d'adaptació a la demanda]
Se que la llengua i cultura no es mercat, però em arribat aquesta situació en la que es necessita que es necessiti el Català, així com a passat amb l'Anglès, es trist..si!
I ara molts direeeeeu...-Aquesta situació de necessitat es per culpa de la opressió!-
Repeteixo, no es sol la opressió, ni passada ni actual, he llegit/escoltat moltes vegades que quan era viu Franco i la prohibició, bla bla bla.
Moltes persones a casa seva varen deixar de parlar el Català i així generacionalment, això no es culpa del tot de'n dictador Franco, doncs, el meu avi mai va deixar de parlar-lo a casa seva, amb la seva gent, no sabia escriure ni llegir en cap de les dues llengües i quan va tindre la oportunitat (òbviament, després mort en Franco) va apendre'n en les dues llengües. Avui a casa tots parlem entre nosaltres el Català. 
El meu germà te 20 anys, juga al PC...(com no..), ell te les dues llengües ben integrades i les utilitza i canvia constantment, en el seu grup de PC hi ha de tot, catalaparlants, amics catalans però que parlen el Castellà i amics de Galícia, Malaga i Madrid, ells en concret, escolten el Català i pregunten que significa tal cosa. Moltes vegades el meu germà ens parlar a nosaltres (gent de casa) i els que no entenen el Català pregunten, -¿De que hablabais?-, pregunten per curiositat, doncs com també he mencionat abans (porta del colegi amb pares i nens), si ho escoltes, et familiaritces i prové del teu entorn segur, aprens i això porta a la pràctica i després a l'ús. Ara ja identifiquen paraules com sopar, gos, treure, menjar... Com entenen algunes paraules saben quina es la frase completa. I això també es el exemple perfecte del que he mencionat anteriorment, altre cop, de "exportar" el Català fora de Catalunya.

RECOMANACIÓ: youtube, -World friends- https://youtube.com/@worldfriends77?feature=shared
Alucinant la conexió entre idiomes aparentment molt diferents.
Parla sense vergonya, parla el Català. I si t'equivoques torna a començar! Visca Catalunya! Un petó a tothom!

2025-02-23 11:55:22 : Questioning My Diagnosis – No Spikes Yet? : kybellatrix : https://i.redd.it/4u3nyhx8ovke1.jpeg

I was diagnosed with diabetes about a month ago with an A1C of 7.9%, which (from what I understand) averages to around 180 mg/dL. However, since my diagnosis, I’ve been testing sporadically, and I’ve yet to catch a significant spike.

This weekend, I decided to experiment a little. I’ve been feeling burned out from my new diet, so I had a more indulgent couple of days—pancakes for breakfast one day, a small amount of rice with dinner, and Pizza Hut cheese sticks another night. I wanted to see how my body reacted to carbs while also giving myself a morale boost.

The first couple of days, I mainly went by feel because, honestly, I hate poking myself. But last night, I finally tested after eating the cheese sticks:
	•	Woke up around 2-3 AM and checked my fasting BG—it was in range.
	•	Ate a little more as a snack and tested 1 hour and 2 hours after.
	•	Highest I hit was 122 mg/dL, and by the 2-hour mark, it was already dropping.

Everything seemed normal. So now I’m left wondering—where are my high blood sugar readings? I know I’m on Metformin (500mg, twice a day), but even before I started the medication, I wasn’t catching anything crazy when I tested randomly throughout the day.

One thing I haven’t tested yet is sweets—cookies, brownies, cakes, etc. I’ve never had a big sweet tooth, so outside of the holidays, I would maybe eat something like that 2-4 times a month. Is it possible that those are the only foods that truly spike me? And that I just haven’t seen a high BG because I haven’t eaten anything like that?

I’m considering testing my BG after a brownie or two to see if that skyrockets it, but I think I’d rather do that while wearing a CGM to avoid all the finger pricks and have continuous data. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Could my A1C have been a fluke, or is my body just handling carbs better than expected? 

TL;DR: Diagnosed with A1C 7.9%, but I haven’t caught a high BG reading yet. Experimented with carbs (pancakes, rice, Pizza Hut cheese sticks), but my highest reading was 122 mg/dL, and it dropped normally. I haven’t tested sweets yet since I rarely eat them—could those be my only spike trigger? Thinking of trying it with a CGM instead of finger pricks. Anyone else experience this?

Long story short. 
I was sick , missed a week of school , told my friend to communicate with the teacher.  I’m thinking he didn’t knowing what I know now … 
Yesterday I learned from another classmate  , that the teacher isn’t allowing me to take the exam and I won’t be able to graduate. 
The teacher also apparently told my classmate and my classmate chose not to tell me. 
The exam is Monday and I was just showing up .. 
I am beyond livid at my “ friend “. When I spoke to him he said he didn’t know how to tell me ..( mind you that is a 23 year old man and the teacher tasked him with that  ) So what was the plan let me get humiliated on Monday ? 
I know my absences were my responsibility and I would do it again. I was in a horrible state. I tried to keep up with school through him .. and he was kinda just holding off and I felt weird. but I really thought he was my friend and he won’t just let me down like this. 
I am beyond pissed and disappointed. 
Had I known before I would’ve contacted admin or something and had at least time to process that now I won’t be able to graduate even.. I am pissed at him and idk if my feelings are valid , am I just angry at the situation ? Was he wrong for it ?

like the phrase goes the nail that stick out the most should be hammered down or something like that

Everyone around me is trying to pull me down like they are rushing me to get a house, rushing me to get an education. I just want this year to myself, to take a breather, to figure out what I want.

Like when I read books my friends and people around me tell me that I shouldn't be reading if I can't make money off it or hobbies are useless if you can't make money off it. Sometimes they'll say that I'm poor while having the hobbies of a rich man. Even saying that travelling when you are young is useless

I have no interest in the singaporean dream, I'm happy with having a small apartment since I don't plan on getting married or even just moving out the country instead of staying here

Drove out and took my daughter for the day, she's 7, loves history and was mega intrigued and wanted to know all about it. Couldn't find any info on it online once we were home and the gent in the cafe had no idea either bless him, was lovely though trying to be helpful with other facts regarding the Priory and grounds.

Any information or sources from books would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Problem is, I havent gotten a placement a month or two and its stressing me out

Ive contacted a place and got turned down due to issues with the business, and ive emailed another 3 other places in the past month and havent got responses (i only emailed one a few days ago, so im giving them the benefit of the doubt rn)

Im searching for a placement in animal care or anything related to that. Ive emailed reptile shops, a cattery, and a vet, but im really struggling to get anything back.

Anyone got tips? Maybe something im missing? Im too anxious to do a phone call or go in to ask, and I feel silly getting my parents to call for me, so emails are all I can really do.

Now he thought about it the lodge master of Novguru must have known when he sent him on this suicide quest. An easy way to get rid of their Soot Forester, a perfect excuse. He should kill Coll if he ever made it back. He imagined the surprise on the Novguru lodge's eyes if they saw him return from a pointless and deathtrap of a task.

He huffed and trudged down the slopes slow, struggling to keep his eyes up, fists clenched. 

It had been burnt through some time ago, raided not too long after that. Weeds were spread in its doorway and a few bones of what he assumed were fellow Takkurangs protruded from under overgrown grass outside the longhouse. It was pointless looking for tracks, the place had long ago been stripped. A rabbit shot out from the undergrowth speeding past him up the mossy slope.

He scanned the basin, empty for the most part. Inside there was still the hint of burning in the air somehow, piles of charcol and ash were all that inhabited the surviving stone walls, half of the roof had collapsed and the other half's half burnt beans looked like giving way. 

Their were a mess of footsteps, passerbys he assumed from the lack of definition on their shoes and rushed markings. Thieves or spys were looking in the wrong place. All the records above ground were paper by design. Lodges kept theirs more indestructible records and goods with their Whisperers, underground. 

He unsheathed his barkblade and lent it against the wall then got to work. Lifting the rubble of broken up rock and fling it over his shoulder. 

He had the refuse cleared by nightfall, exhausted and covered in sweat, moon balm under his eyes. Far off an untasked wolf howled. 

He dragged his hand across the revealed floor until he found the uneven floor board half bent from the collapsed stone. He leveraged it with a knife and yanked it free. He felt a promising drift of stale wind come up from the gap. The entrance was only to deaigned to be accessable by the whisperer below. It took more work than the hiking and the clearing. Planks were scattered behind him, his fingers splintered and bloody. He had been given a task if he didn't come back with answers what was the point of this miserable quest. 

The climb down was easy enough holes had been dug into the walls for purchase. He tore off a rag from his sleeve and plugged his ears. Exhausted, he took his time.   

Two skeletans in druid cloaks lay at the bottom in brotherly embrace. He assumed they starved rather than burnt. Old but still wafting bitterly. They were surrounded with clay tablets of the lodges missions as well as chests of donations of coin.

The records were cyphered, translating them all with his lack of practice would take a season so he looked for the most recent dated. 

It was clasped under bone hands. He gently removed the whisperers arm and it fell to pieces. Across the list of cyphered text was a large clear message in the common tongue chiseled by the blind men in what looked like a messy hurry. He read it over and over. And each time he read he wondered if the whisperers had lost their minds down here.
 

'Cave has been comprimised can no longer speak to the otherside. Summer 401, protect the nymph, task overides others, meet arranged at Curtalis River bend 5 days before the equinox Summer 402 instructions to follow at meet. Requested force: 40 men- Entire lodge minimum. Equipment required: All. Required funds: Entire treasurary. Urgent. Overrides all other tasks. Abandon all other tasks and guideship upon this notice. If found by my brothers know the king of Minloa has ended us before we can spread word to northern lodge. The lodges of the South have stopped communication for some time, assume the worst. Priority will remain, gather all forces with haste and protect the nymph, times of import are upon us, times of a terrible ending. Move with all haste do not seek vengence. Nothing else matters. Protect the Nymph and be his Takkurang or all else is lost. Identity phrase Wooden Star. I pray to Karhu you read this and set out in full force to meet point. I lived by life with noble suffering I am at peace going to the other side, save this realm and all those that still breath the might of all the lodges must rise'

'Fuck' he whispered in the deep.

J’ai un bac+3 un peu « inutile » dans le sens où je ne sais pas faire grand chose grâce à ce diplôme. Je pense que la plupart des gens peuvent faire la même chose en suivant des cours en ligne gratuitement. 

J’ai du des emplois qui n’ont rien à avoir avec mes formations : 
- Photographe (j’aime l’aspect créatif mais je suis une introvertie qui déteste être au contact des gens)
- Marketing Digital (je déteste le sens / l’objectif des missions liées à ce job)
- Recrutement (sûrement le job que j’ai le plus apprécié car les échanges se font à distance par tel ou Visio et sentiment d’être utile / aider MAIS environnement concurrentiel entre les employés, demandes plus ou moins racistes des clients et objectifs à atteindre qui me rendent trop anxieuse : j’ai terminé par faire un burn-out après être passée responsable du département francophone)
- Chargée de clientèle : j’étais un robot. 
- Cinéma : Milieu particulier dans lequel ça me convenait (beaucoup de changements, j’aime ça, stimulant et tâches variées) mais il faut être à paris et cette ville me fout la nausée.
- Barmaid : j’ai envie de pleurer au bout de deux jours de travail tellement la clientèle est insupportable.
- vendeuse : idem que barmaid 
- location ski/surf : ennuyant..
- free-lance graphiste : clients qui ne me paient pas en plus d’être difficiles à trouver étant donné la concurrence en ligne. Créativité endormie car trop de contraintes à respecter dans un cahier des charges, donc aucun plaisir dans la mission.
- free-lance monteuse vidéo : je n’ai jamais réussi à trouver un client à part pour une association donc j’ai fait ça gratuitement

En ce moment je fais un bilan de compétences mais je n’ai pas l’impression d’avancer.
Pour l’instant ce qui en ressort : profil investigateur / social / artistique 

J’ai songé à art-thérapeute, infirmière ou journaliste reporter en free-lance.  Ou carrément lancer ma chaîne YouTube mais j’ai peut-être loupé le coche puis même si ça fonctionne, je ne vais pas avoir des revenus du jour au lendemain.

J’sais pas si vous auriez des pistes pour moi ? Des sites à me recommander ? Des idées de stages ?

2025-02-23 11:56:08 : How would you approach these results? : BigBirdPaints : https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1iw8jcr/how_would_you_approach_these_results/

I will preface this by letting you know that I am dealing with the UK NHS where being your own advocate is basically essential. 

(31f) I have had two sets of bloods done recently: 

28 Jan 2025
Pathology Investigations
Thyroid function test
Serum TSH level 6.32 mu/L [0.27 - 4.2];
Outside reference range
Serum free T4 level 12.4 pmol/L [10.0 -
21.0]
Serum thyroid peroxidase antibody concentration: Positive

19 Feb 2025
Pathology Investigations
Thyroid function test
Serum TSH level 5.62 mu/L [0.27 - 4.2];
Outside reference range
Serum free T4 level 10.6 pmol/L [10.0 -
21.0]

Thanks to this great sub and how knowledgeable you all are I could see that my first results suggest I have hashimotos at a subclinical level. 

Initially I had seen a very good GP who unfortunately retired in between my blood test and follow up, when I returned I found myself with the senior practice nurse. It got off to a rocky start when she asked me why I was there and I pointed out that I was told to make an appt based on my results. To be fair to her, she was very experienced and knowledgeable thereafter, everything she said after that point I couldn’t fault but I could feel she was resisting giving me a prescription. 

I initially sought help because I have gradually been developing fatigue, muscle aches and weakness like I’m wearing chain mail weighing me down, intolerance to cold, Raynauds and carpal tunnel. Brain fog, slow thought, memory issues, dry hair and I think my mood is suffering, apathy and discontentment setting in. 

This time last year I was working part time during the daytime as a handywoman and part time in the evenings managing a bar. It was a lot on the body! I had to stop working for myself last December, figured I was either burning myself out or I was ill. But I am struggling now to keep up with just the one job.

Thyroid issues are on both sides of my family history, both grandmothers, multiple cousins and my mum who my symptoms mimic when she was seeking diagnosis. 

Back to the nurse appointment: I mentioned two things that I thought might help my cause (I want the meds, I need to feel better and sort my life out) 1/ when I had the first set of bloods done I was having a really good couple of weeks! I practically tap danced into the phlebotomists office! I’d even started couch to 5k! But 2 weeks later I was back on the couch aching again. Nurse said okay, there’s a cancellation for bloods tomorrow let’s capture how you’re feeling now - great. 2/ I mentioned that when I was a child I’d told my mum I had a lump in my neck, which is my thyroid and it has been the same all my life. She had taken me to a doctor who had berated her for using an emergency appt (back then before google I think we thought cancer) I couldn’t remember exactly what happened but we were told there wasn’t an issue. Present day, the nurse looked at my medical history and found that my thyroid was tested then (2003) and I had a TSH of 8.0! I’m in the process of requesting all my records from that year to see how this could have been justified as satisfactory. 

Nurse now palpated my thyroid I’m now waiting for an ultrasound appointment. 

I got a call following my second blood test from a cheerful secretary, ‘congrats it looks like your TSH has improved from your last test!’ Not what I was expecting, I feel like sh*te. I look on the NHS app and it shows that my TSH has crept down but my fT4 is only just within range! Why is no one looking at that?! In hindsight it seems obvious the TSH would go down because my T4 had been okay, but look what’s happening when the TSH drops so does the T4 

I now have to wait 3 weeks for another appointment to discuss this an make my case, now I know that I’m not well I’m so impatient to get something sorted. Plus this whole 2003 thing has me thinking, damn have some things I thought were just me (always a little overweight, ADD/hating mental work, suffering after doing exercise) could have been an almost lifelong thyroid issue?! 

Thanks for reading if you got this far x

2025-02-23 11:56:13 : Novated lease - car in joint names : Vivid-Object-139 : https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1iw8jel/novated_lease_car_in_joint_names/

So my leasing company told me my novated lease vehicle needs to be in my name rather than in joint names. I communicated this to the car dealership last week. But when we picked up the car, the registration had been transferred to us in joint names. It's an ex-demo vehicle so was already registered.

We prefer joint names but thought it was not possible with a novated lease. Should I get the dealer to change it to my name? Will the lease company become aware of this? Downsides or risks with leaving it as it is?

Context:
Captain Matvienko is a tank commander and captain of a tank unit which was assigned to be stationed in the Paper world, he was assigned by a secret branch of his nation's government to be a part of secretive interdimensional military operations with his goal being to patrol the military occupation zones in the Paper World from any anomalies, his tank unit often gets into skirmishes and assault operations with anomalous beings (and by beings I meant categories of paper beings similar to Fen and rarely, Alice), although his unit sometimes get into tank battles between local Paper military forces, his orders are to best serve the interests of his nation.

Appearance: Captain Matvienko is a tall, pale-skinned and slightly bearded man with his hair bangs lifting up, he wears a full gear of graphene-coated power armor and is equipped with an electrothermal chemical propelled assault rifle.

Personality:
Captain Matvienko was described by his fellow comrades that he behaves like a protective father to his men, often caring for them personally and in certain situations that he also seem to have a parent-like attachment to them especially with the younger members of his unit, he has a demeanor of a habit of calling his lower ranks as "son", "kid" and "boy", although his demeanor makes him look fierce, alert and serious, on the other side he has a more softer side of himself.

2025-02-23 11:56:13 : Blue Collection Mini Reviews : scharkz24 : https://i.redd.it/6rxgnnbeovke1.jpeg

Hi guys, I thought to mini review my blue fragrance collection since I have decided not to pause my collection since this year (not really). Although i return/sell the ones I do not like, and these are all the ones I love, I will try and arrange them from the order of most liked to least (with ratings).


**1. Bvlgari Aqva Atlantique:** this is a masterpiece of a blue fragrance, to me it has a certain balance and depth with a certain appeal that is missing in most other blues; why this was discontinued is beyond me. Beast mode performance for a blue. **(9.5/10)**


**2. Lattafa Atlas:** acquired taste, very bold and commands attention, for me this DNA is the epitome of a proper marine fragrance, something what Poseidon would wear. Absolute beast mode, probably the strongest of all in the list. **(9.5/10)**


**3. Mancera Aqua Wood:** very unique and pleasing, its a proper niche take on the usual blue DNA, mixing some fruity and floral rose aspect and darker base. Almost beast mode performance, just not huge on projection. **(9/10)**


**4. Issey Miyake Le Sel D'Issey:** the most pleasant marine aquatic, very uplifting and a more wearable oceanic fragrance compared to Atlas for example; absolutely love the scent profile - simple but unique. Great performance, airy and pleasant but very evident. **(9/10)**


**5. Kenzo Homme Marine:** again a very pleasant marine aquatic but with that creamy sun-tan lotion vibe, balances the oceanic feel with that creaminess and sandalwood perfectly, very unique Kenzo DNA. Almost beast mode performance. **(9/10)**


**6. Missoni Wave:** creamy aquatic and the epitome of summer holiday fragrance, puts me in a happy mood everytime i wear, I personally associate it with summer vacation by the beach. Great performance for a scent profile like this. **(9/10)**


**7. Ahmed Al Maghribi Aqua Oud:** the best clone of AdG Profumo, love that mature/bold take on aquatic profile and a perfect daily driver. Almost beast mode performance. **(8.5/10)**


**8. Ahmed Al Maghribi Blue by Ahmed:** best clone of BdC and has that certain appeal and depth with the zing associated with BdC, simple but damn good. Great performance, better than the OG. **(8.5/10)**


**9. Al Haramain Aqua Dubai:** the best imagination dupe for me personally, to be honest I am not a fan of this DNA as its too simplistic and soapy for something so expensive, but this one here is perfectly balanced and pleasant. Beast mode performance. **(8/10)**


**10. Le Chameau Desert Angel Blue Night:** a very unique minty fresh citrusy musky fragrance, supposedly a clone for Blue Moon Ginger Dash By Kilian, super underrated and much better than the Imagination DNA by far. Good performance but I wish it projected slightly more. **(8/10)**


**11. Swiss Arabian Pure Instinct:** like a mix of all famous blues and a swiss army knife of blue fragrances, can be used anytime anywhere for anything, but can be slightly boring as this is nothing unique. Beast mode performance. **(7.5/10)**


**12. Armaf CDN Milestone:** a unique fruity salty and metallic marine fragrance, smells like an expensive resort by the beach or a brunch on a yacht, something old money would be associated with. Almost beast mode performance. **(7.5/10)**


**13. Rochas L'Homme:** a greenish blue fragrance with a certain creaminess, quite unique for a blue but I consider it an imposter among blues, more like a fougere; but I love for what it is. Good performance but I wish it was a little stronger. **(7/10)**


**14. Rasasi Ibreeze:** now this is among my newest purchases and I am not too keen on it, it is a usual aquatic fragrance that is a little close to normal Bvlgri Aqva, nothing too great but not bad either; might change my mind once it matures a little or it would end up getting sold off. Good performance. **(6.5/10)**


Feel free to ask if you want a more detailed review of any of these.

Hello. How goes it? I live in New England. I work from home most of the time and have occasional free time to chat.

In my spare time, I like to get outdoors and hike, bike, and work on my house. I enjoy going to the beach and hanging out by my pool. I like most music, but preferably indie or alt rock. I also enjoy reading in my spare time. And I watch tv. Just started the new season of The White Lotus. 

I like to keep things to the point when posting. So if any of this catches your eye feel free to message me. Please be somewhat local to me if you’d like to chat (east coast USA, NS CA, etc.) Thanks and hope to chat soon.

2025-02-23 11:56:49 : Products I wouldn’t repurchase VS I would : Electrical_Web7621 : https://i.redd.it/hkhxe4eiovke1.jpeg

I’ve done this before but I wanted to update it

Skin type: incredibly dry and sensitive. Skin barrier is prone to damage if not careful 
Skin problems: patchy, flaky, dry skin. redness on cheeks and forehead/whole face. Dark under eye circles. Very very minimal acne on occasion. No texture, doesn’t struggle with creasing.
Make up preference: i wear make up 4/5x out of the week.I like an extremely light weight concealer that isn’t FULL FULL coverage cause I like a no make up kind of look since it’s for everyday. My main concern is just covering up redness and any small marks/discoloration and evening out my skin tone. I hate a dewy look and dislike a satin look, I just don’t like any shine/glow
Skin tone and color: I’m considered a light and I’m neutral but warm leaning 

1. nars light reflecting setting spray: it’s meant to be hydrating which is why I got it but the one time I used it and went out I felt like I looked horrible/it made my makeup look weird??? Maybe cause it was a satin finish and I like matte? That was months ago tbf I barely rmbr and I will use it when I run out of my current trusty elf (black bottle)setting spray to see if I like it again but yeah for the price and that I have way cheaper alternatives I’ll def pass
2. Nars concealer (shades Madeline and vanilla): first of all are we rationing out here? What’s going on with the amount of product ur getting compared to how much ur paying for??? The mini is such a joke!!! A lot of ppl on tik tok were saying this is the #1 concealer but honestly it’s perfectly average like there’s nothing particularly astounding and magical about it. Ik some ppl found it drying but for me it was fine I think? There’s such an enormous amount of concealer options I just don’t believe this is liquid gold like influencers on tik tok say it is.I def don’t reach for this anymore after using it a few times and the price compared to the amount of product?? Not in this economy. Better and cheaper alternatives fs
3. Charlotte Tilbury contour wand shade fair??: first of all $42???? I only got this cause it was trendy on tik tok… why tf influencers gotta be lying to my face like this 😭 dries down way too fast making it hard to blend and the dot turns out patchy/splotchy and u can see the outline of the circle no matter how much u blend I swear. Color is so extremely dark for “fair” and I personally like a slightly sunkissed warmth to my face so I don’t look dead look not a noticeable bronzed/tanned look. And I did in fact accidentally not lock it and it kinda got every where in the cap. I’ll laugh in ur Face if someone ever genuinely recommended this when there’s so many cheaper alternatives 
4. Laura mercier hydrating primer: so it did feel rly nice and hydrating when I put it on it didn’t feel greasy. But the dry patches STILL showed through HOWEVER TBF I didn’t have a skincare routine when I used this so I’m sure it’ll look better if I use it now but the reason why I wouldn’t buy it again is cause I have a cheaper alternative 🤷‍♀️ I do have to say tho it did feel nice and hydrating!
5. Refy blur and hydrate primer: I liked the feel of it but it didn’t feel moisturizing as it felt thin and same w Laura mercier, dry patches still showed but I didn’t have a skincare routine when I tried this so the result could be different. Idk if I can say it really blurred anything either.. has anyone tried this primer? As I said I have a cheaper hydrating primer alt so I wouldn’t buy this again
6. CT spray: okay before I get jumped.. it just didn’t impress me compared to my trusty $6 elf spray!!! I also noticed a lot of times when I used this my face immediately felt so TIGHTTTT and idk why??? I do use this before I put on powder sometimes I’m sure it melts my make up fine and all but it just did not impress me esp for the price. I barely used it I swear and I’m almost done already with it. Ppl say this holds their make up together amazing whether it’s in certain weather or activities or just daily wear but like I said my elf spray does the job too. I also don’t use this after powder cause I hate anything slightly glowy
7. Ole henrikson cc sticks peach and banana: for the price there’s barely any product I feel like it gets used up fast too. My friend said she noticed dark circles improvements in just a few days but I didn’t (tbf I sleep at 6am every day). It’s also SOOOO PATCHY no matter what eye moisturizer I used it was ALWAYS patchy it looked so bad and separated so easily just absolutely not.
8. Gisou lip oil in cherry on top:  liquidy and thin formula. This formula seems to make the lip oil just start gathering towards the bottom of my lips if that makes sense??? 😭 It doesn’t apply evenly and I feel like it REALLY seeps into my lip lines even tho I never have that problem. It also doesn’t last at all I swear it starts fading in 30 minutes. 
9. Summer Fridays balm in cherry: it’s just nothing special 💀 
10. YSL candy glaze lip gloss stick (shade 1)and candy glow balm(shade 5B): just didn’t impress me especially the candy glow balm although I love their love shine lol
11. Dior addict lip glow 007: very drying I can’t even swipe it on my lips smoothly cause it’s so dry and when I put it on my lips look dry it doesn’t feel moisturizing AT ALL like wtf??? 
12. Glossier balm mango: it’s okay it’s nothing special it’s just Vaseline basically. Ppl say they had problems w the formula being weird and oily but mine hasn’t done that so far had it for a few months it’s just a basic lip balm
13. Tarte lip vinyl lotus: VERY GOOPY and stringy!!!! If u especially don’t exfoliate ur lips beforehand and u have dead/peeling skin good luck it’s gonna be a sticky goopy stringy mess!!!!! Absolutely NOT. 
14. Make up Mario contour stick medium: nothing special I wish it blended out faster but that’s it really there’s just nothing special for me to want to repurchase it when I have a cheaper alternative 
15. CT powder: I’ve noticed this makes me slightly orange when I put it on (I did a side by side comparison) and it’s  blurring/smoothing is decent. I feel like it doesn’t hold up my make up that well.. esp for the price it’s just mid even tho ik everyone swears by it. 
16. Huda beauty in poundcake and Laura mercier powder translucent : don’t get me wrong these were nice but because my skin is the way it is these just made my skin look and feel so so so so so dry and look cakey and crusty even tho I would apply as little as I could. It made it look like make up was just SITTING on my face yk?? (BTW I USE LANIEGE NEO BLUR HYALURONIC ACID POWDER since none of my other powders work, so natural yet matte so smoothing and blurring feels so good and it lasts all day, doesn’t make my face feel dry. I’m unsure if Sephora carries this specific product)

PRODUCTS ID REPURCHASE

1. Sephora collection Glossed 10wild: it’s so pretty it feels nice on the lips and for the price hell yeah!!!! Underrated asf
2. Sephora collection lip plump gloss shade 7: same review as the Glossed one!!!
3. Tower 28 hydrating concealer shade DTLA: i like how it feels it obv doesnt feel drying I love the more watery formula compared to the ones I’ve tried it’s so easy to swipe on and blend and for the price?? Yes!! This is my main concealer I don’t see why I’d ever need to switch
4. Haus labs blush hibiscus haze: I LOVEEEEE THE COLOR SO MUCH OMFG it’s so perfect?? I have a tendency to accidentally go heavy handed on powders and most blushes on the market are so high pigmented but that just doesn’t work for me cause I’ll look super crazy. But this blush is very buildable and the pigment prevents me from overdoing it by accident which I appreciate so much. 
5. Laniege lip balm berry:I literally bought this in another shade since I’m half way done. This feels so good and moisturizing on my lips and it lasts hours like my lips just feel so so good!!! And the gloss isn’t sticky and heavy it’s perfect. However the color is pretty sheer if that matters to anyone 
6.  Dior lip maximizer shade holo pink: (this particular color i use as a topper) I have 5 of these… these look so good and I gotta say I would repurchase these!!! They feel good they look good ik ppl say the applicator is tiny but I can apply a perfect even amount with just a few swipes
7. Dior lip oil shade berry: these feel and look SO FREAKING GOOD I love these so much it’s one of my main lippies I have been loyal too since day 1. However I’ve noticed these seem to turn a brighter/cooler pink after a few mins of application I think it’s to match ur ph even tho it doesn’t specify that on the website??? That’s my biggest woe for sure but I would still rebuy
8. Laniege hyaluronic acid cream moisturizer: gave in to the hype and it does feel good but if ur skin is intensely dry def try their intensive cream and I would repurchase these bc ik they have this at tj Maxx for $20 LOL. This does have a fragrance but it’s not strong but I wasn’t expecting it cause why fragrance in skincare lol but my damaged skin barrier had no reaction to it so yay
9. YSL blush shade 93: SORRY LMFAO I ACTUALLY WOULDNT REPURCHASE THESE simply cause of the price 
10. YSL love shine lip oil stick shade 44: I have 5 of these they apply soooo freaking smooth and it feels moisturizing and not dry I love how it feels on my lips. This particular shade looks really diff on me/pulls off cool toned than the model pics which I found disappointing. My everyday shade is 209! 
11. YSL bronzer: THE TIK TOK INFLUENCERS WERE RIGHT FOR ONCE THIS IS THE BEST CREAM BRONZER IN THE WORLD there is simply no competition. At first I was intimidated by the color but it blended out BEAUTIFULLY and SOOOOOO quickly i was genuinely impressed and I rarely ever am!!! Absolutely amazing product so creamy and insanely affordable YSL deserves more love I also have their highlighter

2025-02-23 11:56:46 : Those with nieces and nephews under 18, how do you approach speaking about veganism? : Empty_Code_8664 : https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1iw8jpd/those_with_nieces_and_nephews_under_18_how_do_you/

My niece is 16 years old and I’m somewhat close with her. I see her a few times a month and we do things together with the rest of the family. Her parents and the people that she lives with eat the standard American diet. Over the last few years I’ve spoken about why I’m vegan. She has said in response that one person‘s actions doesn’t really make a difference for animals and that vegan food isn’t normal. She’s called it “woke” and refuses to try anything. She’s called bacon a beautiful thing. She does have cats and loves them a lot, but I think has put other animals likes pigs into the food category like a lot of people do.

I know she has influence from her family, friends, and the media, but it’s still frustrating. I would like to help her better understand how the “normal people food” is made and the reality of how animals are hurt in the food industry, but I know she can’t really make decisions for herself because she doesn’t have a job yet and is at the mercy of her parents. I think they are the main reason why she thinks vegan food is not normal and they don’t have a lot of money, so her asking them to accommodate her is probably a no-go.  

So those of you with nieces and nephews with a similar situation, how have you approached it? Are there any books or videos that you would recommend sharing? Or should I wait until she’s more in a position to be able to do something different if she thinks that’s what she should do after learning about this issue?

Any advice would be appreciated!

2025-02-23 11:56:59 : Seeking Advice on Tokenization and Funding for Real Estate and Agricultural Project : Gold-Ad5286 : https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1iw8jso/seeking_advice_on_tokenization_and_funding_for/

Hello, Reddit community!

I’m reaching out to share my situation and seek advice or collaboration on how to tokenize my assets and secure funding for a multifaceted project based in Punta Arenas, Chile. Here’s an overview of my situation:

# Project Overview:

I am developing a project that includes several tangible assets:

1. **Wind Energy Contracts:**
   * We have two contracts that are expected to generate approximately **$2 million annually** once they are operational, which is projected to be between **2026 and 2027**. While these wind farms are not yet constructed, they are close to breaking ground, and the revenue will provide a stable cash flow for our operations.
2. **6-Hectare Commercial Land:**
   * This land is located on the same site as one of the wind farms and has multiple potential uses. We plan to develop this land further once we secure the necessary permits.
3. **Residential Complex:**
   * Currently, we only have one house on the property, but the land itself is strategically located in the city and valued at around **$4 million**. The goal is to construct a modular building with 30 apartments to generate rental income.
4. **Agricultural Ranch:**
   * We operate a **10,000-hectare ranch focused solely on sheep farming**. Our infrastructure is designed for sheep, and we aim to improve productivity by enhancing pastures and ensuring better water access.

# Funding Challenge:

The main issue we face is that we currently have very little cash on hand—just enough to keep us afloat. We urgently need an injection of capital to move forward with these projects and improve our cash flow significantly.

# Our Vision: Tokenization as a Solution

We are considering tokenizing our assets as a way to raise capital while offering investors a stake in our diversified portfolio of real-world assets. The idea is somewhat similar to factoring but with more flexibility.

* **Digital Tokens Backed by Tangible Assets:** Investors would hold tokens representing ownership or participation in the revenues generated by our wind energy contracts, residential complex, ranch, and commercial land development.
* **Dividend-Based Returns:** Token holders could receive dividends from the profits generated by these projects over time.

# What We’re Looking For

We’re seeking advice or collaboration on the following:

1. **Tokenization Strategy:** Is tokenizing these assets the right approach? Are there better alternatives?
2. **Funding Mechanisms:** What other funding strategies could work for us? How can we leverage our existing contracts and assets to secure financing?
3. **Collaborators or Experts:** Developers who can help design secure smart contracts for tokenization, legal experts familiar with tokenized assets, or platforms that could facilitate this process efficiently.

If you have experience in similar projects or insights into tokenization and funding strategies, I would greatly appreciate your thoughts! Thank you for your help!

Best regards,  
Stipi

I'm making some modifications to a transformers figure, and I want to fill some hollow gaps with E6000 so I have more area for the plastic to come in contact with when I glue it in place. I'm thinking of using superglue to glue it to the actual plastic of the figure.

(I know E6000 is an adhesive, but when it cures, it becomes like a gel or a something similar, so if I put it in the gap and let it cure, it'll be like using expoy or resin and fill up that gap)

Then I was gonna use superglue on the area. Will it work or will something go bad and destroy the gel stuff?

Hi! I am an Italian guy who loves videogames, metal, beer, nature, cats, sea, WWE and more. 😊

I'd like to find a friend who I can be myself with, without judgement, even to talk about our fears why not.
Something that have good vibes and where you can speak about what you want without any problem.

Possibly a girl because I am missing that side and I feel the need of a girly vision of things, to have differents perspectives and advices that aren't the "usual manly advice", since I already have like 10+ male friends and not a single girl-friend. (I am a lot shy with girls, so it's pretty hard for me to knew one, I am working on that 😅)
I am living a chaotic situation on the romance side, and an opinion, or even just a listener would help a lot.

2025-02-23 11:57:19 : US Teachers - Could you share past exam examples? UK parent trying to show daughter what American teens study : Extreme_Driver_4040 : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeachers/comments/1iw8jyz/us_teachers_could_you_share_past_exam_examples_uk/


Hi everyone!

I'm a parent and teacher from the UK, and my daughter is currently preparing for her GCSEs (our national exams taken at age 16). She's really curious about what high school students learn in the US, and I thought it would be fascinating to show her some examples of what American teens study at the same age.

Would any teachers be willing to share examples of past papers or final exams that your students take? We're particularly interested in core subjects like English, Mathematics, Science, and other subjects in particular Geography /History. It would be amazing to show her the different approaches to education across the pond!

I know every state has their own system, so I'd love to see examples from any region. If you're able to share. 

Of course, I'm only looking for materials that are okay to share publicly - nothing current or confidential!

This would be such a great learning experience for my daughter, and it might help her put her own exam prep into perspective.

Thanks in advance! 🇬🇧🇺🇸

Edit: Just to clarify - we're interested in regular high school exams, not AP or IB tests.

We have implemented the Guided decisions application and are working with Decision trees applied to Recommended actions in the Service Operations Workspace for incident management (Washington). The business requires to copy the answers given in the decision tree and paste them to the work notes, instead of having to open the side panel history. This would allow to see questions and answers in the classic UI rather than having them only in the history panel which is quite hidden (there is no indication that the action was already completed unless you actively look for it in the history). I cannot find where the answers are stored, and I'm open to suggestions on how to complete this task!

2025-02-23 11:57:27 : No, That's Awful. Chapter 30-34 Spoilers : Defiant_Owl_1435 : https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/1iw8k1h/no_thats_awful_chapter_3034_spoilers/

1. So you actually fight/encounter Behemoth a total of 10 times, and she doesn't actually manage to kill anyone in any of those fights/encounters.In the first fight when Behemoth tries to take the coffin from Grave, Super Saiyan Rapi gets dunked on, and Eunwha commands Absolute to create an opening so she can shoot Behemoth in the knee. I'm fine with this one, because Behemoth is playing around with them at this point, and doesn't actually care about defeating them.

2. In the second encounter, while trying to recover the coffin from Behemoth, she surrounds all the characters (main character, Absolute, Counters) except Grave in crystal, and promises to kill anyone who talks out of line. Which is strange because she already knows that Grave is the only one with the information she needs, so her insistence on interrogating these guys is weird. She could have just said she wanted to talk, no coffin talk involved, but she specifically wanted to interrogate them.

But then she proceeds to do absolutely nothing, even as the main character has an entire chest gag with Eunwha, she throws him the disk, he throws the disk outside the crystals, then shouts at Mana to activate the stake, then the stake flies and lands, and ONLY after the stake begins destroying the crystals is Behemoth allowed to react because she just forgot to stop the characters from doing... everything they did in that awfully written scene. 

Then, to add fuel to the fire, the characters shoot Behemoth in the stomach to immobilize her at the main character's orders, even though the main character saw Dorothy walk off a stomach wound with ease two weeks ago during the Reclamation Site 01 battle. HE ALSO KNOWS BEHEMOTH'S WEAKNESS IS HER KNEE JOINTS, BECAUSE HE JUST SAW EUNWHA TEMPORARILY IMMOBILIZE HER EARLIER. Do that but with more bullets! But no, he shoots Behemoth in the stomach, where she has a concentration of the black goo that he himself thought was a defense mechanism. What a genius. And Eunwha praises him for this dumpster fire too. And Rapi and Grave have a casual multiple minute long conversation before fleeing, because Behemoth just gets completely forgotten.

3. The third fight is the one where Behemoth launches off the building and annihilates everyone except for the main character and Grave. She spears Eunwha with crystals because she isn't playing around anymore, except then she just oneshots Super Saiyan Rapi along with everyone else without bothering to kill them, and then Behemoth flees with the coffin again. The main character and Grave then proceed to carry six unconscious Nikke to safety, even though that shouldn't be possible since Grave would be carrying five of them, and she doesn't have the wingspan for that. The power? Yes. The literal arm capacity to carry five bodies? No. Also, the main character couldn't have carried two Nikke, because he was already struggling significantly with only one Nikke. If you struggle to carry something, you cannot then carry something that weighs as much, or even half as much, because that's going far over your weight limit.

Behemoth then conveniently forgets to take Grave with her, and Leviathan says she's coming over because she's sick and tired of Behemoth's loneliness schtick getting in the way of their plans. This one will be important later for fight six.

4. This is one of the justifiable ones. The smokescreen Stake Attack was overcomplicated, but it actually made sense why it worked, even if taking Behemoth's clamp out was somewhat unnecessary, and having the main character hit Behemoth with the clamp was an unnecessary risk.

A better version of the plan is that Super Saiyan Rapi rushes in the moment the smokescreen goes off, and Mana fires the stake preemptively, so the moment Super Saiyan Rapi hits Behemoth with the disk, the stake impales her. If you want to destroy the clamp? Do the same thing, but Super Saiyan Rapi goes after the clamp, and another Nikke handles slapping Behemoth's stomach with another disk. Then she gets double penetrated in quick succession, without being able to properly react. No need to do the extra rigmarole where everyone except the main character runs out of the smokescreen, and then the main character slaps Behemoth with the stake because she... would somehow completely forget about him when she sees he's the only one that didn't run out of the smoke.

  
5. The fight after the Glass Container boss. Behemoth goes berserk this time, and doesn't hold back, except she does a little bit. She ragdolls everyone, impales the main character in the stomach, and cuts Vesti in half. But she never actually manages to kill anyone, despite the fact that it's stated that she immediately goes head to head with Cinderella after fighting all of them.

So Behemoth is powerful enough that she can go toe-to-toe with holding back Cinderella, (Who's supposed to be far stronger and faster than Super Saiyan Rapi) but she wasn't able to kill ANYONE? Despite the absurd speed and strength gap? Remember that Indivilla moved so quickly, while not trying no less, she was able to cut Anis and Neon in half before they could react. She was a blur, and that's when she wasn't even trying. Super Saiyan Rapi is faster than that, and Behemoth is far more dangerous than even Super Saiyan Rapi. So a character who's so fast (Behemoth) she blitzes a character (Rapi) who blitzes a character (Indivilla)who blitzes normal Nikkes and the main character... isn't able to destroy anyone before Cinderella reawakens?

And what happened to brains not being able to last long outside of those special containers? Shouldn't Vesti be dead just because they had no storage containers, and no way to get her back to base in minutes? Eunwha is up in the air, because Hammering took a while to be corrupted, but that was in her arm. Eunwha gets multiple, including through the chest, so she should've probably had some crystals in her head by the time she's sniping Behemoth, but I'll say that's up in the air. Emma gets hit with crystals too, but she would've been in the early onset phase, so her survival is fine.

6. When Leviathan first shows up, Behemoth shows up right there with her... and then the two get humiliated by basically Grave alone. Cinderella is only able to reclaim her weapons because Behemoth is too busy arguing with Leviathan to pay attention.

  
A sin for Leviathan not killing the main character here is necessary. The ENTIRE reason why Leviathan is here is because she's sick and tired of Behemoth being lonely, and allowing her loneliness to get in the way of their plans. She's literally here because she refuses to let Behemoth's need for new company get in the way of their plans, and that's why she entered the Crystal Region.

But if that's true, why does she listen to Behemoth when she says to kidnap the main character so they could talk to him? During that very conversation, she says she wanted to kill him, but Behemoth stopped her so they could talk to him.

But then Leviathan learns that the main character is dangerous, and NOW she REALLY want him dead... so she tells Behemoth to do it, knowing that Behemoth will refuse because of her obsession with new company.

Leviathan was completely comfortable killing the main character PERSONALLY until Behemoth wanted to talk, but now that Leviathan really wants him dead... she pushes the job off onto someone she knows won't want to do it? What is this writing?

7. After the stupid talk between Behemoth, Leviathan, and the main character, backup arrives in the form of Cinderella, followed by the rest later. Cinderella attacks Leviathan, sending her far away from Behemoth and the main character, but then the main character teleports over to Leviathan, threatening Behemoth not to attack Cinderella or Leviathan gets his blood.

Behemoth then believes him, despite the fact that she knows she's infinitely faster than he is, and could destroy him in less than a heartbeat. The point was that Cinderella couldn't attack because she was recharging, and the others weren't there yet, so Behemoth easily could have killed the main character and then attacked Cinderella, but she stops, despite the fact that she knows she has complete power in this situation. Behemoth launching off the building happened earlier that day, as the main character was only out for three hours, and when he woke up, they received information from the government almost immediately afterwards and set off. This means Behemoth watched the main character punch her in slow motion in Fight 5, and completely blitzed everyone with her building lunge in Fight 3, but she actually thought he was faster than her. For some reason.

8. After the black wave, which only knocks the main character out somehow, despite being a 40 foot tall wave or liquid metal or whatever, Behemoth and Leviathan acknowledge they completely forgot to check if he was even alive, somehow. Leviathan says that they're going to keep him alive, because they need to see if everything he said earlier was true.

What?

So they needed him alive, so Leviathan could absorb information from the Nikkes in the Black Bubbles? Even though that has nothing to do with him? I'm pretty sure they even know that Counters is his squad, so they definitely don't need him, because they would have seen everything he's seen. Even if they weren't with him all the time, they still didn't need him alive, because he doesn't serve a purpose anymore. It doesn't even matter if he's telling the truth or not, because the information they were interested in was whether or not he actually was familiar with, and had defeated Heretics. They know how strong Super Saiyan Rapi is, or at least Behemoth does, so she should know that he's telling the truth, because she also fought Liberalio, Nihilister, and Indivilla. She knows how strong all of them are, and subsequently knows that Super Saiyan Rapi could defeat Nihilister, Indivilla, and Chatterbox at the same time.

9. Cinderella breaks out of the Black Bubble and annihilates Behemoth and Leviathan. Fine. Then Leviathan separates Grave and Cinderella, and Behemoth traps the main character in crystal before ragdolling the Counters. She's still not killing them, for some reason, and then Absolute attacks her and she flees.

 Behemoth then regroups with Leviathan, and the two lick their wounds. But why are Behemoth and Leviathan so interested in fighting now? "We always ran away because it was the smart thing to do. So now that we know that we're entirely outmatched and can't win against Grave and Cinderella, let's fight against Grave and Cinderella."

The plan was to separate Grave and Cinderella from the rest, but Cinderella just destroyed them, and neither Behemoth or Leviathan know whether or not Cinderella can do that again. In fact, they should have every reason to believe that she should. So the two pick a fight with characters who they know could destroy them instantly, even though their pragmatism is responsible for them running away from the fights they couldn't win before, like against Nihilister, Indivilla, and Liberalio.

10. Finally, the main character, Counters, and Absolute fight against Behemoth while Leviathan faces off against Grave and Cinderella alone. Why didn't Leviathan just make a massive bubble, trapping the main character, Counters, and Absolute inside, killing them while Behemoth stalls against Cinderella and Grave? I don't know. Why didn't Leviathan use the Ocean of Black to separate Grave and Cinderella, forcefully tunneling them to another location, and then reconvening with Behemoth to annihilate the main character, Counters, and Absolute? I don't know.

Regardless, Behemoth unironically activates Ultra Instinct, because that's how she fights best, and then fights against everyone with efficiency, winning despite being outnumbered. She then proceeds to throw Neon and Anis into a wall, before inexplicably taking her time with the main character, despite knowing she's still surrounded by able threats.

Imagine if you had the ability to kill the king while surrounded by dangerous knights, and then you decide to completely leave your back open so you could slooooooowly kill the guy. She was flailing incessantly before this, and eliminates Anis and Neon instantly, but then she only shows down for the main character? Why?

11. I admit it, I'm being powergated and haven't finished Chapter 34 yet. But I know that Behemoth loses, even after transforming, and Leviathan somehow ends up fleeing with her core. What I do know is that after all of this, Behemoth somehow doesn't manage to kill anyone, despite fighting them so many times. Does this make her a jobber? Or just a victim of disgusting amounts of plot armor?

  




Side note.

The entire Crystal Region makes no sense because of Leviathan and Behemoth's backstory. Leviathan and Behemoth hate the other Heretics (Indivilla, Nihilister, Liberalio (They know Chatterbox, but they don't mention him as one of the ones that drove them off)) because they all bullied them and tried to kill them, forcing Leviathan and Behemoth to flee. But Behemoth alone is so strong that she mollywhops Super Saiyan Rapi every time they fight.

But Super Saiyan Rapi curbstomped Nihilister, Indivilla, and Chatterbox at the same time, and only didn't kill them because of her time limit. So if Rapi is much weaker than Behemoth, then how did both Leviathan and Behemoth lose against the three Heretics?

Behemoth should've been able to destroy Nihilister and Indivilla by herself, and then she and Leviathan team up against Liberalio. But they somehow completely lost and fled because they were too weak? How were they too weak to defeat enemies weaker than an enemy they're far stronger than?

People could argue that Liberalio was much stronger, but if that were the case, Behemoth and Leviathan would have said that. "Nihilster and Indivilla weren't the problem. Liberalio, she's the real monster..." 

But they never do that! So they just lost to enemies they're far stronger than? What sense does that make? The Crystal Region only exists BECAUSE they were forced to flee!

I tried to locate a mineshaft and it gave me the cords but the mineshaft was nowhere to be found from bedrock to the surface at those cords. How would this even happen?

2025-02-23 11:57:40 : Whe you apply Private Perms to CAT there should be a choice to apply to ALL channels : virtualburn : https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1iw8k5u/whe_you_apply_private_perms_to_cat_there_should/

The fact this doesn't exist is actually disturbing.  I just did a long required audit of our dicord and set reaction roles to over 40 categories, each has a minimum of 4 channels... I had to create a lot of new roles and apply to these CAT's and to find this doesn't propogate down - even by choice - is beyond annoying.

I now have to right click and edit EVERY channel that has a CAT that went through a change is utterly ridiculous.
